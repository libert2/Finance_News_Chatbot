            "Telecom sector in 2017: A year marked by bitter competition and consolidation\n",
            "In what could be considered a landmark year for the telecom sector in India, 2017 saw telcos consolidate like never before. By the end of the year, there were only three major players left in the market. \n",
            "Moneycontrol NewsOn Tuesday, Anil Ambani-led Reliance Communications said that the telecom sector has become a money guzzler where only those with deep pockets can survive.Even the &amp;quot;mighty&amp;quot; house of Tatas had to &amp;quot;gift away&amp;quot; their telecom business (to Airtel), Ambani asserted, sounding bitter about the regulatory framework. He said the long time taken to clear&nbsp;RCom's merger with Systema Shyam Telecom represents an &amp;quot;unease of doing business&amp;quot;.For every telecom company in India that cannot be considered a giant in the sector, the last couple of years have been the same. Companies have had to either pump in a lot of money into their business to stay competitive enough to survive, or merge themselves with other companies. And as if that were not enough, when companies did try to merge with each other, they were held up by regulatory hurdles.So when Reliance Jio finally arrived late last year, other telcos were left high and dry quite literally. According to a report by Kleiner Perkins Internet Trends 2017, India&rsquo;s wireless consumer data prices fell 48 percent as incumbent mobile operators responded to Jio&rsquo;s pricing.The Jio effectAs of September this year, the top three telcos in the country had together lost over 50 lakh subscribers, according to a report by Business Standard. Idea and Vodafone had lost 28 lakh and 24 lakh subscribers, respectively, while Airtel's base contracted by two lakh subscribers, the report said.However, Prashant Singhal, Global telecommunications Leader at EY, told the newspaper that for a market like India, it was the revenue that must be monitored to check a telcos' health rather than the subscriber base.&amp;quot;The health of industry is driven by revenue and we have to see if revenue is shifting in favour of&nbsp;Reliance Jio.&nbsp;In India, people have got multiple SIMs and losing subscribers does not give a clear indication of an operator&rsquo;s health,&amp;quot; Singhal said.Both Airtel and Vodafone were forced to slash tariff after they started losing customers to Jio. However, the two companies continue to charge for voice calls and text messages, at least on some of their plans, whereas these services are offered free of cost by Jio on all its plans.The country's largest telecom operator&nbsp;Bharti Airtel's consolidated net profit for the second quarter fell 6.6 percent, dented by pricing pressure, while Vodafone saw its operating profit fall 39 percent year-on year in the first half of this fiscal year.Speaking to The Economic Times, Bharti Airtel's Sunil Mittal had said that Jio's entry with prolonged free offers had led to unexpectedly rapid consolidation.&amp;quot;Market has consolidated to a level which was an aspiration, but never thought would be a possibility. Now we're looking at 3-4 players. Number 2 Vodafone and Number 3 Idea being put together, is unprecedented... you never see two strong companies merging...this is just because the market structure has got completely damaged,&amp;quot; he told the newspaper.Mittal estimated that around USD 40-50 billion (approximately Rs 2.5-3.2 lakh crore) has been written off by various telecom companies, which he believes is &amp;quot;largely due to Jio&amp;quot;.However, Reliance Industries Chairman Mukesh Ambani quickly rebutted Mittal, saying businesses must stop looking at regulators and governments to guarantee their profits, according to a report by Gadgets Now.Speaking to CNBC-TV18, former chairman of Micromax Sanjay Kapoor said in October that consolidation in the telecom space is good, while competition remains severe.According to Kapoor, two things are happening in the sector. Firstly, there is clear consolidation in a space where an unsustainable perfect competition structure is dying down. A more sustainable structure is now coming into shape and three long-term players seem to be standing out.Secondly, he said, Jio starting to publish its earnings numbers will drive change in behaviour of other telcos, considering their revenue steams had been completely disrupted by the new carrier.According to a report by The Hindu BusinessLine, analysts at Goldman Sachs feel that as a result of consolidation, consumers can hope to benefit from their service providers who are on a stronger footing to expand their networks and improve quality of service.Indian telecom companies are now looking for mergers and acquisitions to stay ahead of the competition. In February, Telecom Secretary JS Deepak said that the Indian telecom market would eventually consolidate to have only five major players. He also said &amp;quot;consolidation is going to be very good for India as we are likely to get four private and one government player (BSNL-MTNL), which is ideal.&amp;quot;According to the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI), there were more than 1.18 billion wireless telephone subscribers in the country in April this year, being serviced by as many as 12 operators.For the telecom sector in India, 2017 was a year marked by unprecedented consolidation. Here are some of the&nbsp;key mergers and acquisitions of the sector from this year:Airtel and Tata TeleservicesIn October, Airtel announced a merger&nbsp;of its mobile operations with struggling Tata Teleservices. According to the deal, Airtel would acquire Tata's consumer mobile business in 19 circles.The merger was done on a debt-free, cash-free basis. The deal also gave Airtel access to Tata's 1,800, 2,100 and 850 MHz spectrum bands, all widely used for 4G. In December, both boards had cleared terms for the customer business merger.Vodafone and Idea CellularIndia's second largest (Vodafone) and third largest (Idea) telecom operators are now in the process of merging to form what would become the country's largest operator. The merged entity will also be the world's second largest telecom service provider.According to the terms of the deal, Idea's parent entity Aditya Birla Group will gradually raise its stake in the combined entity while the Vodafone Group will reduce its stake until both their shares are equal. The two companies have received regulatory approval and have started picking key executives. They are hopeful that the merger will be concluded in 2018.Airtel acquires Telenor India and TikonaIn February, Airtel bought Telenor's ailing Indian subsidiary, Telenor India. According to the deal, Airtel took over Telenor India's liabilities pertaining to licence fees and lease obligations for mobile towers.The deal, which gave Airtel 44 million additional users, did not involve any cash payment to Telenor. Airtel also got Telenor India's 43.4 MHz spectrum in the 1,800 MHz band as a part of the deal.In September this year, Airtel announced it had fully acquired Tikona Digital Network's share capital. Earlier, the company had announced a plan to purchase Tikona's 4G airwaves for Rs 1,600 crore. The acquisition gave the Sunil Mittal-led telecom company access to Tikona's 4G spectrum in five circles.Reliance Communications and AircelIn April 2017, Reliance Communications and Aircel approved a merger that would create one of the largest networks in the country in terms of subscribers. RCom and Aircel's parent firm Maxis were supposed to own 50 percent stake each in the merged entity.The proposed merger was crucial for RCom as it would have retired Rs 25,000 crore of debt from its total debt of around Rs 45,000 crore. However, RCom shelved merger talks with Aircel, citing regulatory uncertainties.On December 26, RCom unveiled a new resolution plan to reduce its debt by up to Rs 39,000 crore through prepayment and sale of assets and form a new RCom with debt levels of less than Rs 6,000 crore.The resolution plan involves exiting strategic debt restructuring (SDR) and monetising some of the company's assets, including transfer of spectrum liabilities by March 2018.Disclaimer: Reliance Industries Ltd. is the sole beneficiary of Independent Media Trust which controls Network18 Media &amp;amp;amp; Investments Ltd\n",

            "Sudarshan Sukhani of s2analytics.com told CNBC-TV18, &amp;quot;Reliance Industries is a buying opportunity separately and individually. This stock apparently was in a trading range for three weeks and is now willing to go higher; that is the sense I get.&amp;quot;He further added, &amp;quot;Cipla is a buy. There was a decent and reasonable correction in the stock and that correction was over. Yesterday we had a very good day in Cipla and that is probably a signal that the uptrend should continue.&amp;quot;&amp;quot;My old favourite, Hindustan Unilever (HUL) is a buying opportunity. We have had three down days in it; it did not participate in this 10,500 record at least. However, there is a narrow range and there is an inside day. So HUL is probably willing to join that party again.&amp;quot;&amp;quot;Yes Bank has come in buy list earlier. After that very large decline, it was flat and consolidating, and that consolidation to me is taking the shape of a bullish pattern. So, we are literally buying on a dip if we are right. So Yes Bank is a buy.&amp;quot;&amp;quot;Bank of Baroda from the PSU banks, is a short sell. Keep short sells only intraday.&amp;quot;&amp;quot;Both crude and ONGC are likely to go up higher. Crude itself after that consolidation is inching up, and in ONGC, the bear market is over. There is more of a rally here. I am not sure if they are correlated, they could be, but separately also ONGC is upbeat.&amp;quot;&amp;quot;Tata Steel and Yes Bank are buying opportunities. Both are absolutely on the verge of significant breakouts.

            "Sudarshan Sukhani&nbsp;of s2analytics.com told CNBC-TV18, &amp;quot;It does appear after a consolidation that lasted for almost three months, Reliance Industries is giving the first signs of willing to go higher again. It has been an outperforming stock and that consolidation was simply a pause. So, today I would feel that Reliance is one of the best buys that we can look at and these are not day trades you must carry them and take the risk for a Monday result event then these trades will really benefit us.&amp;quot;&amp;quot;Ajanta Pharma as a buying opportunity for the day. It already broke out from a very nice attractive base and now it is having those large rallies, then 3-4 days small pause and then what I assume will be a resumption of that rally. Ajanta Pharma is a buying opportunity.&amp;quot;&amp;quot;Zee Entertainment is on the verge of a breakout. That breakout should be coming, so we want to be positioned in anticipation of an upside breakout again. That is a buy.&amp;quot;&amp;quot;Hexaware Technologies is in a trading range, a small flag like formation tells us that a breakout is imminent on the upside and that could lead it much higher.&amp;quot;&amp;quot;One short sell and that is simply to balance it out. I don&rsquo;t think we should be short today.

            "OpenSignal, a London-based firm which specialises in crowdsourced wireless coverage mapping all over the world, says Jio may make 2018 the year in which it decides to raise prices. \n",
            "Moneycontrol NewsAfter a year in which it has shaken up the telecom sector with cheap data and free voice calling, Reliance Jio may hike tariffs in 2018, according to a report.OpenSignal, a London-based firm which specialises in crowdsourced wireless coverage mapping all over the world, said that although Jio&rsquo;s entry into the market resulted in data prices becoming much cheaper&nbsp;&ndash; which resulted in increased number of 4G consumers &ndash; it doubts whether Jio will be able to retain its position at the helm.&amp;quot;The trend will continue next year. Whether Jio remains a huge dominant driver in 4G growth remains to be seen. After a year of free and steeply discounted data pricing, Jio may make 2018 the year it raises prices. That could level the playing field for India's operators,&amp;quot; said Andrea Toth from OpenSignal.Since its launch in September 2016, Jio has&nbsp;triggered a bitter price war with the existing players&nbsp;in the market. With Jio&rsquo;s highly disruptive entry, all the telco players saw a sharp decrease in revenues and had to drastically&nbsp;change their strategy and product mix in order to find other ways of generating revenues. Such was Jio&rsquo;s impact that voice and SMS services, which once generated a lion&rsquo;s share of revenue for telcos, are now being offered as freebies.With data priced at &lsquo;next to nothing&rsquo; on launch, Jio's customer base grew at a dizzying pace. Reliance Jio Infocomm Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of Mukesh Ambani led Reliance Industries, added a customer base of about 16 million in the first month of its launch. The company crossed 50 million subscriber mark in 83 days of its launch, becoming the fastest company ever to do so.&amp;quot;Jio's widespread 4G access, along with its at-first free and later heavily discounted data and voice plans, quickly won the hearts &mdash;&nbsp;and wallets &mdash;&nbsp;of more than 100 million mobile users across the country,&amp;quot; Toth added.Jio not only made 4G VoLTE a household name but also helped transform India's image of a country struggling to develop 4G VoLTE technology to one of the top countries in terms of 4G VoLTE connectivity and reach and the fastest growing mobile market in the world.Disclosure: Reliance Industries, which owns Reliance Jio, also owns Network18, which publishes Moneycontrol.com.\n",

They have gone through deep correction. Some of them have not corrected but the NBFCs were correcting. Now that entire sector is coming into play as also private banks. So, financials have gone through a sideways market and a correction and that should outperform now.&amp;quot;&amp;quot;This is really a stock pickers market. You could close your eyes among the bluechips, pick anything and it will make money hopefully. Bharat Forge is a buy today. That stock is an outperformer and it should remain an outperformer.&amp;quot;&amp;quot;M&amp;amp;amp;M Financial Services was one of the NBFCs which did not correct, had a very mild nominal correction. If this market goes up and of course no one knows, I hope it does go up, there are enough signs. M&amp;amp;amp;M Financial should be an outperformer again.&amp;quot;&amp;quot;Mahanagar Gas&nbsp;is sort of bull stock, minor correction, trading range and new highs again. Much bigger theme is do not try to go short in this market.&amp;quot;&amp;quot;Grasim Industries is not a stock that people have made money, it is not even a favourite of the market. So for retail investors there is no reason to be in this stock, absolutely no reason. Sell Grasim, there are many other opportunities which this channel keeps on talking about, but exit Grasim,&amp;quot; he said.&amp;quot;NTPC is part of the power sector which is looking up after many years. So NTPC is now probably giving us more momentum on the upside. It is a buying opportunity and so is Tata Power, Adani Power, and so is CESC. That entire sector is in momentum now.

            "The Chairman and Managing Director of Reliance Industries delivered a speech about India&rsquo;s rise in the world order and the role it could play to lead the fourth industrial revolution.\n",
            "Moneycontrol NewsFormer US President Barack Obama had just left after his session at the Hindustan Times Leadership Summit 2017. Moving from shadows in the audience to under the spotlight, Mukesh Ambani played it ever so smoothly. He called upon the &ldquo;big boys&rdquo; of the telecom sector to look beyond profits and losses, and instead think about the difference they were making to the consumer, and thereby to the country.The Reliance Industries Chairman and Managing Director had just delivered a speech that talked about India&rsquo;s rise in the world order and the role it could play to lead the fourth industrial revolution. Post his speech, Ambani answered a few questions posed by Hindustan Times Editor-in-Chief Sukumar Ranganathan.&ldquo;To me what is most important is 'Do we really move the country forward' and 'Does the consumer gain?' and I think that the question as a journalist that you should be thinking about is that 'even if there are profits and losses, who gains and who loses, and as long as the consumer gains, and the country moves forward, it's worth taking those losses, right? Some of us are big boys, we can afford that,&rdquo; Ambani said in reply to a question that referred to a recent statement by Bharti Airtel Chairman Sunil Mittal.That message would surely travel fast; Sunil Mittal's brothers, Rakesh and Rajan, were a part of the audience.Mittal had recently said in an interview that Reliance Jio Infocomm&rsquo;s entry into the sector had led to its rivals writing off USD 50 billion in investments. Ambani may have a point. With the entry of Jio in September last year, data tariffs have fallen to a fraction of their levels a year ago while India&rsquo;s ranking in terms of data consumption has jumped to number one from 150. Some of Reliance Jio&rsquo;s rivals have been around in the industry for over 20 years.Delivering his speech that lasted 25 minutes, Ambani said RIL was willing to go beyond the Rs 60,000 crore it had put in its last investment cycle for the next round of growth. He listed agriculture, education and healthcare as three areas on the group&rsquo;s roadmap where it saw tremendous opportunities.&ldquo;Five years ago, when most Indian businesses were investing outside India, we decided to invest about USD 60 billion in India. We have nearly completed this investment cycle and we are now ready to commit even more in our next investment cycle. We are doing this out of our undiminished conviction that India is the next biggest investment opportunity in the world,&rdquo; Ambani said.He said the time had come for a combination of technologies to play a role in agriculture, education and healthcare and solve societal problems without bothering to turn to governments and regulators for profits and losses.&ldquo;This (agriculture) is a difficult problem to tackle but we are ready to take on difficult problems. It&rsquo;s very much on our roadmap, building of the resources, thinking through. We don&rsquo;t just jump into anything, we think through it carefully. Agriculture, education and healthcare, all three are on our roadmap which, to my mind, are the most difficult,&rdquo; he said.He called upon foreign investors to &ldquo;invest in India, earn in India, grow in India, partner and prosper together with India&rdquo;. Ambani said by the middle of this century, India&rsquo;s rise would be higher than China&rsquo;s and more attractive and give the world a &ldquo;superior development model&rdquo;.He said, &ldquo;We are in the age of super-intelligence. What manufacturing was for China, super-intelligence will be for India.&rdquo;He said India&rsquo;s USD 2.5 trillion&nbsp;economy would most certainly hit the USD 5 trillion mark well before 2024 and then double by 2030.He said the next three decades will be most defining for India and the country was positioned to lead the next revolution. He said by 2050, the country would have 300 million more people to feed. &ldquo;There is a pressing need and golden opportunity to create a digital green revolution. Data is not only the new oil, data is also the new soil,&rdquo; he said.He said the fourth industrial revolution would be led by connectivity, computing, data and artificial intelligence. He said the new age would have three defining characteristics &ndash; the first being the exponential changes that technology would bring as against linear changes that happened earlier.The second defining characteristic, he said, would see scarcity giving way to abundance &ndash; abundance of abundance of energy, health, agricultural output, manufacturing capacity, abundant knowledge and renewable materials.The THIRD defining characteristic would be a migration from a goods and services economy to one powered by intelligent services.&ldquo;There is no doubt that in the coming years, machine intelligence will augment and multiply biological intelligence manifold,&rdquo; Ambani said.(Disclosure&nbsp;: Reliance Industries Ltd. is the sole beneficiary of Independent Media Trust which controls Network18 Media &amp;amp;amp; Investments Ltd.)\n",

            "The bonds were priced at 3.66 per cent, the lowest coupon ever achieved by an Indian corporate for a 10-year issuance, the company said in a statement.\n",
            "Reliance Industries today said it has raised USD 800 million by selling 10-year bonds - the first offering since Moody's raised India's sovereign rating.The bonds were priced at 3.66 per cent, the lowest coupon ever achieved by an Indian corporate for a 10-year issuance, the company said in a statement.RIL, which is rated the same as the sovereign, will use the proceeds to refinance existing debt. This was the first dollar note this year.The note by RIL, India's largest company, was assigned 'BBB+' rating by S&amp;amp;amp;P and 'Baa2' by Moody's Investors Service.&amp;quot;The notes have been priced at 130 basis points over the 10-year US Treasury Note, at a price of 100 to yield at 3.667 per cent,&amp;quot; the statement said.They will bear fixed interest of 3.66 per cent per annum, with interest payable semi-annually in arrears and shall rank pari passu with all other unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of the company.This, RIL said, was the tightest ever spread over US Treasury for an Indian entity for a 10-year issuance. Also, it was the tightest ever spread over US Treasury for a 10-year BBB corporate issuance from Asia ex-Japan since the global financial crisis.&amp;quot;The company will use the proceeds to redeem its existing USD 800 million 5.875 per cent senior perpetual fixed rate unsecured notes pursuant to the terms of such notes,&amp;quot; it said.The notes were over 1.6 times oversubscribed across 90 accounts.V Srikanth, Joint Chief Financial Officer, RIL, said: &amp;quot;This refinancing transaction was well received by high quality investors across asset managers, insurance companies and banks and helped us achieve substantial savings in interest cost over the life of the notes.&amp;quot;Issued against the backdrop of the upgrade of the country ratings by Moody's, RIL successfully concluded a swift intra- day execution to capitalise on the market window, he said. &amp;quot;We are delighted to have issued 10-year bonds at the lowest coupon ever for an Indian corporate.&amp;quot;Once a net zero-debt company, RIL has borrowed heavily to fund its mega 4G telecom rollout. The company's debt swelled to Rs 2,14,145 crore at the end of September as compared to Rs 1,96,601 crore as on March 31, 2017. Cash in hand was marginally lower at Rs 77,014 crore.Assigning its 'BBB+' rating for the bonds issue, S&amp;amp;amp;P Global Ratings had yesterday stated that RIL continues to bolster its business profile with new growth projects in its already large, integrated and efficient oil refining and petrochemical businesses.&amp;quot;The completion of recent investments in the refining and petrochemical segment will further add to the company's cash flows,&amp;quot; it said, adding that RIL's diverse businesses with high levels of integration help offset the cyclicality inherent in the oil and gas and petrochemicals industries.S&amp;amp;amp;P said RIL is on track to achieve Ebitda of about Rs 70,000 crore in the current fiscal and Rs 90,000 crore in 2018-19.Ebitda was Rs 32,500 crore for the first half of the current fiscal.Moody's Investors Service had separately stated that RIL's Baa2 rating reflects the company's strong ability to generate operating cash flows, with annual Ebidta exceeding USD 10 billion from its large-scale integrated refining and petrochemical operations &mdash; which generate strong margins &mdash; and the company's nascent but growing digital services business.Reliance Industries Ltd. is the sole beneficiary of Independent Media Trust which controls Network18 Media &amp;amp;amp; Investments Ltd.\n",

            "The aggregate picture, that was quite dismal in the run up to the GST in the previous quarter, has got better. Our analysis of over 4200 companies showed tepid growth in topline, but surprisingly there was a marked improvement in margins. Finally, unlike in the previous quarter when profitability declined, there was some revival in the September quarter with the trend line flattening.\n",
            "Madhuchanda DeyMoneycontrol ResearchThe quarterly earnings season was overshadowed by macro events like the government&rsquo;s recapitalisation of public sector banks, massive road sector capex and the more recent Moody&rsquo;s ratings upgrade. While the notable earning hits and misses did get the attention of the market, the aggregate numbers may give the big picture.Hearteningly for the bulls, Indian Inc managed to overcome GST and demonetisation blues, and reported a decent operating performance overall.The long road to profitabilityThe aggregate picture, which was quite dismal in the run-up to the GST in the previous quarter, has got better. Our analysis of over 4200 companies showed tepid growth in the topline, but surprisingly there was a marked improvement in margins. Finally, unlike in the previous quarter when profitability declined, there was some revival in the September quarter with the trend line flattening.Importantly, the absolute number of companies reporting losses fell to 36 percent of the universe during the September quarter compared to 37 percent in the previous quarter.Nifty &ndash; a much better showThe large-cap universe did not disappoint. For Nifty companies, aggregate revenue growth was a tad lower compared to the June quarter. However, EBIDTA (earnings before interest, depreciation and tax) rose 14.7 percent year-on-year growth against a decline of over 5 percent in the preceding quarter. This aided the near double-digit growth in profit for the Nifty aggregate.A key macro enabler of the performance, particularly for domestic-focused businesses was the re-stocking post GST implementation. An early festive season and the near-normal rains also aided sentiment.Domestic-focused businesses like automobile, cement, consumer staples and consumer durables reported a good quarter. In the post result commentary, most companies said post GST restocking was gathering pace.The winners from Nifty were names like Reliance Industries, Tata Motors, GAIL and ONGC. Bharti Airtel also reported a marked improvement in internals with strong cost control in India wireless and decent margin performance in Africa.For financials, it was a mixed bag. While the likes of HDFC duo and IndusInd Bank were the usual steady performers, asset quality divergence took some sheen off Axis Bank and Yes Bank. For the rest, namely ICICI Bank and SBI, provisions remained elevated though incremental asset quality pain was not visible.For the defensive sector, there wasn&rsquo;t anything overtly different to reverse the cautious outlook. In the reported numbers of most of the large IT companies, the struggle to drive growth, the trade-off between growth and margin and slow hiring were visible.For most of the pharmaceutical companies caught between regulatory overhang and pricing pressure in the US generic business, there was little respite in the regulated markets. However, the India business appears to be getting back on track with restocking happening at a brisk pace.The BSE 500 universe &ndash; early green shoots&nbsp;The bigger winners of the rally in the markets have come from a broader universe like the BSE 500. At an aggregate level, the performance looks subdued compared to Nifty. But the broad trend was similar, with a distinct improvement in operating performance that had a positive rub-off on profitability.While generalisation of the broad universe is incorrect, it was heartening to observe many winners within BSE 500 coming from a range of sectors. Hence, it wouldn&rsquo;t be wrong to conclude that the green shoots are emanating from different pockets.There were a few sectoral winners like aviation, where all three listed airlines stocks reported strong numbers. Companies catering to metal and allied sectors also fared well.A lot of the other winners, however, stood out on the strength of their respective business models. The notable names in this category are Avanti Feeds, Avenue Supermart, Bharat Forge, Caplin Point Lab, Chennai Petrochem, Dalmia Bharat, Godrej Industries, Godrej properties, Rain Industries, Future Retail etc. Our analysis suggests that close to 10 percent of the BSE 500 universe&nbsp; reported very healthy numbers.The positivity is yet to reflect in the fortunes of companies that are critically dependent on the investment cycle. Infrastructure bellwether L&amp;amp;amp;T continues to remain sceptical about the revival in private capex.Government capex, nevertheless, has gathered steam and the same was reflected in the much improved earnings of companies working in the road sector. Dilip Buildcon, IRB Infra and Sadbhav reported numbers that were worth taking note of.BSE Midcap &ndash; weighed down by leveraged companiesIn the BSE Mid Cap index, the bottomline performance was subdued compared to the operating numbers, with the indebted firms in the index to blame. The other important constituent, namely some of the mid- sized public sector banks, continued to disappoint on reported financials although there was visible improvement in incremental asset quality pain.The laggards in this index were the over-leveraged companies like &nbsp;Adani Enterprise, GMR Infra, Jindal Steel and Power, Reliance Communications, Tata Communications, SAIL etc and the beleaguered lenders like Canara Bank, Central Bank and IDBI Bank.What to expect from the market now?India&rsquo;s overall macro indicators had worsened in recent times with growth falling, inflation firming up and crude looking set to spoil the party. However, we feel the recent reform announcements offer hope.The economy is gradually coming out of the impact of twin disruptions of demonetisation and GST. Recent reports suggest that GST collections are improving. Finally, while monsoon was a bit lower, it wasn&rsquo;t altogether disappointing.The fiscal neutral recapitalisation of PSU banks should help expedite the bad loan resolution process and eventually pave the way for revival in private capex after some serious restructuring in the state-owned banking sector. Till such time, it will be a journey of gradual revival with government in the driving seat to fill the void of the private players.With minimum political risk in the horizon, relative strength of the macro and the green shoots from corporate earnings (the second half of FY18 has the support of a low base of last fiscal), markets are unlikely to de-rate. But further re-rating will be gradual as valuations at 21X FY18P earnings are not exactly cheap.The relative strength of India vis-&agrave;-vis other economies and the fundamental shift in household savings pattern should keep the momentum going in the medium term. Investors should be watchful of any dip to accumulate well researched stock ideas.(Disclosure : Reliance Industries Ltd. is the sole beneficiary of Independent Media Trust which controls Network18 Media &amp;amp;amp; Investments Ltd.)For more research articles, visit our&nbsp;Moneycontrol Research Page.\n",

            "Sudarshan Sukhani of s2analytics.com told CNBC-TV18, &amp;quot;There are opportunities in midcaps because if the index is not doing anything, largecaps are also sitting ideal. So, Biocon is a buying opportunity.&nbsp;The stock had a two or three day correction, and that correction seems to be getting over and already some minor signs of strength is coming intraday.&amp;quot;&amp;quot;Adani Ports&nbsp;is a very strong stock. It had a pause and that pause could easily end up in a resumption of the up move.&amp;quot;&amp;quot;The NBFCs which have been my theme. Bajaj Finance is a short sell and short selling should be done only intraday. It is possible that the markets may cheer up by the time we close,&amp;quot; he said.&amp;quot;Hold Eicher Motors. This is an outperformer and we are in the beginning stages of a bull market; Eicher Motors will then surprise on the upside and we cannot imagine how much, inspite of these levels. So just hold on and stay with it.&amp;quot;&amp;quot;Sell ONGC. There is nothing in the stock, in the sense that I am saying nothing, it is not a reflection on the company. The share price tells us that it is underperforming and the business tells us it could underperform for years to come. So while it may still go up, there are many better opportunities in the financial services sector, private banks, in FMCG&nbsp;and in Reliance Industries independently. So why ONGC, Reliance is a much better option,&amp;quot; he added.\n",

            "Reliance Industries has awarded a major contract for bringing to production the R-Series gas field in the flagging KG-D6 block to US engineering and construction company McDermott.R-Series is one of the three sets of discoveries in the eastern offshore KG-D6 block that RIL and its partner BP of UK are working to bring to production by 2021-22 to reverse the declining trend in output.McDermott on its website confirmed award of the contract but did not give value of the deal.&nbsp;The company said it will provide &amp;quot;engineering, procurement, installation and pre-commissioning of subsea flowlines, vent lines, and a pipeline-end manifold for connection with six subsea wells in the R-cluster field at a water depth of up to 6,890 feet (2,100 meters).&amp;quot;This is the first of three planned projects in KG-D6 that RIL-BP had announced in June, involving a cumulative investment of Rs 40,000 crore and producing from about 3 trillion cubic feet of discovered gas resources.The R-series (D34) project is a dry gas development in water-depths of more than 2,000 metres, about 70 km offshore.&nbsp;It is to be developed by linking six producing wells with existing producing facilities at Dhirubhai-1 and 3 (D1&nbsp;and D3) gas fields in the block.&amp;quot;The project is expected to produce up to 12 million cubic metres of gas a day, coming on stream in 2020,&amp;quot; RIL-BP had said in June.McDermott said in addition to the R-Cluster of six subsea wells, RIL can give it the job of five to seven more subsea wells at the Satellite-cluster fields in the KG-D6 block.&nbsp;&amp;quot;The optional scope also consists of two additional subsea structures and flowlines at a water depth between 4,593 feet (1,400 meters) and 5,905 feet (1,800 meters),&amp;quot; it said.McDermott said it plans to leverage its significant experience and presence within India including its Engineering Center of Excellence office in Chennai providing engineering and project management oversight for the project.RIL-BP had in August 2013 won approval to invest up to USD 3.18 billion to produce gas for 13 years from D-34 (R- Series) discovery in the KG-DWN-98/3 or KG-D6 block.The planned output from D-34, which is estimated to hold an in-place reserve of 2.2 trillion cubic feet, more than double of the combined current production from Dhirubhai-1 and 3 (D1 &amp;amp;amp; D3) gas field and MA field in the KG-D6 block.RIL had originally put the recoverable reserves in D-34 at 1.413 Tcf that could produce a peak output of 14.9 mmscmd. However, the Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH) trimmed the recoverable reserves to 1.191 Tcf and peak output to 12.9 mmscmd.The Dhirubhai-34 or D-34 gas discovery in the southern part of KG-D6 block in Krishna Godavari basin was notified in May 2007. The find was declared commercially viable by MC in November 2011.RIL has so far made 19 gas discoveries and one oil find in the KG-D6 block. Of these, D1 and D3 gas fields were brought to production in April 2009, while MA oilfield began pumping oil in September 2008.Disclaimer:&nbsp;&ldquo;Reliance Industries Ltd. is the sole beneficiary of Independent Media Trust which controls Network18 Media &amp;amp;amp; Investments Ltd.&rdquo;\n",

            "&amp;quot;Such payments along with additional capex towards telecom services will constrain any reduction in net borrowings until fiscal 2019,&amp;quot; it warned\n",
            "Global ratings agency Moody's Investors Service has revised upwards its credit outlook on Reliance Industries (RIL) to stable and affirmed its Baa2 ratings on the energy conglomerate's long-term issuer debt.But the agency has warned of higher borrowings by the country's richest and the most profitable company over the next 18 months to pay back its creditors for the large capex it had incurred on telecom and refining &amp;amp;amp; petchem expansion.&amp;quot;Such payments along with additional capex towards telecom services will constrain any reduction in net borrowings until fiscal 2019,&amp;quot; it warned.&amp;quot;We have revised our outlook on the domestic long-term issuer rating of RIL to stable from positive, while the outlook on the foreign currency senior unsecured rating is maintained at stable. The outlook on Reliance Holding US is also maintained at stable,&amp;quot; Moody's said in a note today.&amp;quot;The rating affirmation at Baa2 reflects expectation that RIL's credit metrics will recover over the next 12-18 months and be better positioned for its ratings as it continues to increase its earnings from the recently completed and ongoing projects in the refining and petrochemical segments,&amp;quot; said Vikas Halan, vice-president and senior credit officer at Moody's.The Baa2 ratings also reflects RIL's strong ability to generate operating cash flows, with annual EBITDA exceeding USD10 billion from its large-scale integrated refining and petrochemical operations with strong margins and its nascent but growing digital services business, he added.&amp;quot;The change in the outlook on the Baa2 domestic issuer rating reflects the increase in RIL's business risks because of its growing digital services segment and our expectation that the high capital spending will keep its free cash flow negative over at least next 18 months,&amp;quot; said Halan, who is also Moody's lead analyst for the largest corporate entity in the country with a Rs 6 trillion market capitalisation.He said though RIL's refining and petrochem capex is almost complete, cash outflow will still remain high as payments to creditors for the past capex are made over the next 12-18 months.&amp;quot;Such payments along with additional capex towards telecom services will constrain any reduction in net borrowings until fiscal 2019.&amp;quot;Retained cash flow adjusted to net debt improved to 16 percent in fiscal 2017 from about 14 percent in fiscal 2016, but remains weak for its ratings, Moody's said.The rating firm said it anticipates retained cash flow /adjusted net debt improving to over 20 percent in fiscal 2018.(Disclosure: Reliance Industries Ltd. is the sole beneficiary of Independent Media Trust which controls Network18 Media &amp;amp;amp; Investments Ltd.)\n",

            "Reliance Industries and its partner BP plc of UK have submitted to the government a USD 2 -2.5 billion plan to bring to production India's deepest gas discovery by 2021-22.The partners yesterday submitted to the Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH) a field development plan (FDP) for the MJ-1 gas find, which is located about 2,000 meters directly below the currently producing Dhirubhai-1 and 3 (D1 and D3) fields in the eastern offshore KG-D6 block, sources with direct knowledge of the development said.MJ-1 is estimated to hold a minimum of 0.988 Trillion cubic feet (Tcf) of contingent resource.With this, RIL-BP have finalised investment plans totaling USD 5-5.5 billion (about Rs 33,000 crore to Rs 36,000 crore) for three sets of discoveries in the KG-D6 block.Earlier this month, they submitted an FDP of USD 1.4 billion for bringing to production six satellite gas discoveries in the block.RIL-BP combine had in 2013 submitted a USD 3.18 billion investment plan for D-34 or R-Series gas field in the same block, sources said adding the actual investment in the find may actually be USD 1.4-1.6 billion only.Sources said the investment in MJ-1 would be slightly higher because a floating production storage and offloading (FPSO) will be used to produce the gas.Work on the three sets of discoveries will start sometime in 2018 and contracting for equipment and services has already started.In May 2013, RIL, BP and Niko Resources of Canada had struck a 155-metres thick gas condensate column in the exploration well KGD6-MJ1, which was later named as D55 or MJ-1 discovery.MJ-1 is one of the three clusters that the partners are focusing on reviving the flagging output at KG-D6.Besides MJ-1, four deep sea satellite gas discoveries &mdash; D-2, 6, 19 and 22 are planned to be developed together with D29 and D30 finds on the block. The investment in these satellite fields would be USD 1.4 billion.The third set is the D-34 or R-Series find.All the three sets of finds will produce 30 to 35 million standard cubic meters per day of gas, sources said.RIL and BP had in mid-June this year announced investing Rs 40,000 crore in the three sets of finds to reverse the flagging production in KG-D6 block.RIL has so far made 19 gas discoveries in the KG&mdash;D6 block. Of these, D&mdash;1 and D&mdash;3 &mdash;&mdash; the largest among the lot &mdash;&mdash; were brought into production from April, 2009, but output has fallen sharply from 54 mmscmd in March, 2010, to 3-4 mmscmd.MA is the only other field that was put to production. Together, the three fields today produce less than 6 mmscmd gas.Other discoveries have either been surrendered or taken away by the government for not meeting timelines for beginning production.RIL is the operator of the block with 60 per cent interest while BP has 30 per cent stake. Niko has the remaining 10 per cent shares.Reliance Industries Ltd. is the sole beneficiary of Independent Media Trust which controls Network18 Media &amp;amp;amp; Investments Ltd.\n",

            "This change is part of the broader set of recommendations that the regulator is expected to frame on the subject of interconnection. The official said a decision on the quantum of reduction hadn&rsquo;t yet been taken yet.\n",
            "Dhirendra Tripathi Moneycontrol NewsThe Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) is likely to cut down the number of days &ndash; currently 90 &ndash; a service provider gets to allow calls generated from another service provider&rsquo;s network to start terminating on its own, an official familiar with the development told Moneycontrol.This change is part of the broader set of recommendations that the regulator is expected to frame on the subject of interconnection. The official said a decision on the quantum of reduction hadn&rsquo;t yet been taken yet.The recommendations on the subject, expected to be issued in a fortnight or so, will be an amendment to the existing policy.&nbsp; The official said the new guidelines would aim to bring in more transparency and a level-playing field in the sector while cutting down scope for litigation.The principle of interconnect is at the heart of a landline/mobile service since a call can start only when the service provider of the &lsquo;called party&rsquo; allows the service provider of the &lsquo;calling party&rsquo; to interconnect or terminate the call on its network. Unless there is an agreement between the two service providers on this, a person will not be able to call another user.The issue of interconnect has always been a hotly contested issue in the Indian telecom sector, often used as a tool by the then incumbent to thwart competition. Most recently, Reliance Jio Infocomm found itself at the receiving end when incumbent operators did not provide enough interconnection to it at the time of launch of its services last year. This resulted in Reliance Jio customers&rsquo; calls to users of other companies not going through.The Reliance Industries subsidiary was forced to approach the regulator to help resolve the issue. TRAI then found that these telecom companies weren't providing enough points of interconnect to the new entrant. It then recommended to the Department of Telecommunications to impose penalties of Rs 1,050 crore each on Bharti Airtel and Vodafone India and Rs 950 crore on Idea Cellular. The matter is sub judice now.The physical part of the interconnect ecosystem works like this. A service provider first prepares an estimate of the number of subscribers it would have by a certain date. Based on that figure, it asks for points of interconnect from the other service provider to allow its own users to be able to call customers of the other operator. New requests for interconnect are made as and when fresh estimates of the number of users are made.Based on the number of points of interconnect it wants the other company to release, the first company makes a payment to the other one which has 90 days from then on to issue the number of PoIs requested.The issue of interconnect is of vital importance to TRAI since it lies at the heart of the regulator&rsquo;s most important objective of consumer interest. It comes under TRAI&rsquo;s quality of service rules. Maximum call failure rate permitted by the regulator is 0.5 percent. A call fails when the interconnection doesn&rsquo;t happen.As opposed to data consumption, interconnect is more important for voice services as no such interconnection is needed to access data.(Disclosure : Reliance Industries Ltd. is the sole beneficiary of Independent Media Trust which controls Network18 Media &amp;amp;amp; Investments Ltd.)\n",

            "Reliance Industries and its partner BP Plc of the UK will invest about USD 1.5 billion to bring to production six satellite gas discoveries in the flagging KG-D6 block by 2022.RIL-BP combine yesterday submitted to the Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH) a field development plan for what are known as satellite and other satellite fields, sources with direct knowledge of development said.They plan to develop four deepsea satellite gas finds, named D-2, 6, 19 and 22, together with two other nearby finds, D-29 and D30, in the Krishna Godavari basin block.In all, 5-6 gas producing wells will be drilled and tied to production facilities, they said adding peak output may be in the range of 10 to 12 million standard cubic meters per day.The four satellites and the two other satellite finds (D29 and D30), R-Series and MJ gas discoveries, are the ones on which RIL and BP had in mid-June this year announced investing Rs 40,000 crore to reserve the flagging production from KG-D6 block.Sources said development of the six satellite finds are being taken up together while D-34 or R-Series and D-55 (MJ) would have separate development plans.The government had in 2012 approved a USD 1.529 billion plan to produce 10.36 million standard cubic meters per day of gas from four satellite fields of block KG-DWN-98/3 (KG&mdash;D6) by 2016-17.The four fields have 617 billion cubic feet of reserves and can produce gas for eight years.However, the companies did not begin the investment citing uncertainty over gas pricing.Now that the government has allowed a higher gas price of USD 6.3 per million British thermal unit for yet-to-be- developed gas finds in difficult areas like the deepsea, RIL and BP have decided to take up their development.This rate is comparable with USD 2.89 per mmBtu for currently producing fields.Sources said these four finds are now been clubbed together with D29 and D30 discoveries, which had been held up over conformity tests.RIL-BP combine does not plan to alter the USD 3.18 billion investment plan for D-34 or R-Series gas field in the same block, which was approved in August 2013.About 12.9 mmscmd of gas for 13 years can be produced from from D-34 discovery, which is estimated to hold recoverable reserves of 1.4 trillion cubic feet.A separate development plan for the MJ find would be submitted by mid-2018, they said.RIL has so far made 19 gas discoveries in the KG&mdash;D6 block. Of these, D&mdash;1 and D&mdash;3 &mdash;&mdash; the largest among the lot &mdash;&mdash; were brought into production from April, 2009, but output has fallen sharply from 54 mmscmd in March, 2010, to 3-4 mmscmd.MJ is the only other field that was put to production. Together, the three fields today produce 6.4 mmscmd.Other discoveries have either been surrendered or taken away by the government for not meeting timelines for beginning production.Reliance Industries Ltd. is the sole beneficiary of Independent Media Trust which controls Network18 Media &amp;amp;amp; Investments Ltd.\n",

            "The company met market expectations on refining margins but positively surprised the market by posting a profit at the earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) level in its telecom operations.\n",
            "Moneycontrol ResearchAnalysts were closely watching out for two key data points in Reliance Industries September earnings. One was the gross refining margin and the other was the losses in its telecom subsidiary Jio.The company met market expectations on refining margins but positively surprised the market by posting a profit at the earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) level in its telecom operations. Since its launch in September 2016, it was for the first time that Jio&rsquo;s financial numbers were made public.Jio, a late entrant in the telecom space, took the sector by storm with tariff rates way below competition. The aggressive pricing helped the company build a customer base of 138.6 million users within a year.Surprisingly, despite the aggressive pricing, Reliance has been able to post average revenue per user (ARPU) of Rs 156.4 as compared to Rs 154 of market leader Bharti Airtel. The management is confident of improving its ARPU further, which will help the company report profits sooner than most analysts expect.For the September quarter, Jio reported revenues of Rs 6,147 crore and a marginal loss of Rs 270.59 crore. The company posted an operating profit of Rs 1,443 crore at an operating margin of 23.5 percent.The numbers highlighted the changing dynamics of the telecom sector with data now taking center stage. Total wireless data traffic in Reliance Jio&rsquo;s network was 378 crore GB. High data usage in the Reliance Jio&rsquo;s network helped the country reach the highest per capita data consumption of 9.62 GB per user per month in the world. With 80 percent of the country&rsquo;s data capacity, a large chunk of the growth in per capita numbers can be attributed to Reliance Jio.Jio&rsquo;s coverage area is likely to spread to 95 percent of the country&rsquo;s population by 2018, making its network greater than that of any 2G player in the country. As its reach spreads, Jio&rsquo;s revenues are expected to increase further with a corresponding increase in ARPU driven by value-added services.The drop in interconnect usage charges (IUC) and a substantial improvement in its service quality with less than 0.4 percent call drops are likely to boost Reliance Jio&rsquo;s numbers, according to analysts. The company has announced bookings of JioPhone, which were stopped earlier because of unprecedented demand that will add to its subscriber base.Analysts have started upgrading their earnings estimates after seeing the first set of numbers this quarter. With value-added services and products expected to be launched in future and Reliance Jio&rsquo;s numbers will continue to be the most awaited one among Reliance Industries different business.(Disclosure : Reliance Industries Ltd. is the sole beneficiary of Independent Media Trust which controls Network18 Media &amp;amp;amp; Investments Ltd.)\n",

Numbers except bottomline beat analysts&rsquo; expectations.Revenue from operations grew 5 percent sequentially and 16.5 percent year-on-year to Rs 95,085 crore in second quarter of FY18, driven by growth across segments - petrochemical, refining, organised retail and digital businesses.&amp;quot;Another quarter of robust performance includes the financial performance of Reliance Jio which had a positive EBIT contribution in its first quarter of commercial operations,&amp;quot; Mukesh Dhirubhai Ambani, Chairman and Managing Director, Reliance Industries said.The results also reflected strong underlying fundamentals of refining and petrochemicals businesses, he added.Brokerages are largely upbeat about the core and operational performance and pin hopes on telecom business to turn profitable soon.

            "&amp;quot;Relinquishment of Myanmar Block &ndash; M17 and M18 on completion of study/others technical evaluation assessment period,&amp;quot; RIL said in an investor presentation post announcing its second-quarter earnings.\n",
            "Reliance Industries has exited the last of its overseas oil and gas assets after it relinquished two blocks in Myanmar.&amp;quot;Relinquishment of Myanmar Block &ndash; M17 and M18 on completion of study/others technical evaluation assessment period,&amp;quot; RIL said in an investor presentation post announcing its second-quarter earnings.With this, the oil-to-telecom conglomerate is left with no conventional oil and gas property overseas. It has just two shale gas assets in the US.Earlier this month, it sold one of the three shale oil and gas blocks it had in the United States for USD 126 million, a third of the price it paid seven years ago.RIL held stakes in three US shale gas ventures - 45 percent with Pioneer Natural Resources in the Eagle Ford shale play; 40 percent with Chevron and 60 percent with Carrizo Oil &amp;amp;amp; Gas in the Marcellus Shale play.&amp;quot;Reliance signed agreements to divest all of its interest in the upstream shale gas assets operated by Carrizo,&amp;quot; it said in the presentation. &amp;quot;Transaction is expected to close by the end of 3Q FY18.&amp;quot;The billionaire Mukesh Ambani-led firm had in 2007 set up Reliance Exploration and Production (REP) DMCC primarily for acquiring overseas assets.It had steadily acquired 16 conventional oil and gas assets, including four in Peru, three in Yemen (one producing and two exploratories), two each in Oman, Kurdistan and Colombia and one each in East Timor and Australia. It last bagged two oil and gas exploration blocks in Myanmar in 2014.But the company slowly exited most of its international assets.It last withdrew from Block 39 in Peru. RIL held 10 percent interest in the block. Anglo-French oil and gas company Perenco held 55 percent stake in the block while PetroVietnam of Vietnam held the remaining 35 percent.The Myanmar exploration blocks were awarded to RIL in March 2015. It held 96 percent stake in each of the two blocks with the remaining 4 percent being with a local company.RIL's domestic oil and gas business portfolio, which at one point of time comprised of 42 blocks or fields, has shrunk to five conventional oil and gas assets and two coal-bed methane (CBM) blocks.As part of its upstream (hydrocarbons exploration and production) portfolio rationalisation, the company has been exiting those assets which it feels are not going to give a good return on investment.According to RIL's latest annual report, the company's present domestic portfolio comprises the flagging KG-D6 block in the Krishna Godavari basin, Mahanadi basin block of NEC-25, CB-10 in Cambay and GS-01 in Saurashtra basin.Besides, it also has a stake in Panna/Mukta and Tapti oil and gas fields in the Arabian Sea. However, Mid and South Tapti fields have been abandoned after production tapered.Also, it has two CBM blocks in Madhya Pradesh.RIL had in February 2011 announced a &amp;quot;transformational&amp;quot; deal when UK's BP picked up 30 percent stake in its 23 oil and gas blocks for USD 7.2 billion. However, in August that year, the government allowed them to form a partnership in only 21 blocks.Since 2012, RIL and BP have been pruning their portfolio, shedding not so viable acreage. They are now left with just three blocks - the producing KG-DWN-98/3 or KG-D6 block in Bay of Bengal, gas discovery areas of NEC-OSN-97/2 (NEC-25) and CB-ONN-2003/1 in Cambay basin.(Disclosure: Reliance Industries Ltd. is the sole beneficiary of Independent Media Trust which controls Network18 Media &amp;amp;amp; Investments Ltd.)\n",

            "Reliance Industries rose to a record high of Rs 891 on the BSE for a second consecutive day in a row on Friday just ahead of its results for the quarter ended September 30. The oil &amp;amp;amp; gas major will declare results post market hours.Consolidated profit is expected to be at Rs 8,169 crore for the quarter against Rs 9,079 crore in previous quarter. According to an average of estimates of analysts polled by CNBC-TV18, earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortisation (EBIDTA) is likely to be strong at Rs 13,178 crore, compared with Rs 12,554 crore in June quarter.Edelweiss Securities expect a robust Q2FY18 performance for the Oil &amp;amp;amp; Gas sector, following an operationally strong Q1FY18. For RIL, strong refining will be somewhat offset by subdued polyester spreads.However, the ramp‐up in new capacities and benefit of ethane imports will buoy earnings. It estimates a strong quarter with standalone PAT of Rs8800 crore, up 7 percent QoQ. The GRM could surprise D-Street at USD 12.4/bbl (up 4% QoQ), a USD4/bbl premium over Singapore benchmark.After witnessing the breakout of 8 years consolidation (from September 2008 till December 2016) between Rs560 to Rs340 levels, the stock has been in an uptrend across all the time frames.The stock has been in an uptrend throughout 2017, thanks to optimism around its telecom venture, Jio and a sharp improvement in refining margins. RIL gained over 60 percent so far in the year 2017, compared to 20 percent rally in the S&amp;amp;amp;P BSE Sensex.However, since the last three months, the stock has undergone a consolidation phase wherein the prices have traded in a broad range of Rs870-760. This consolidation phase seems to be a time-correction in the prices, suggest experts.&ldquo;Chart pattern indicates that if the stock faces any profit booking, it may find support around Rs 770-760 levels; however, any breakdown below Rs 760 would accelerate the selling in stock which may drag it towards Rs 723-710 in short-term,&rdquo; Rajesh Palviya, Head Technical &amp;amp;amp; Derivative Analyst, Axis Securities Ltd told Moneycontrol.However, if stock observes breakout from its consolidation range (Rs 870-760) then it is likely to scale towards 930-950 levels in short to medium term, he said.The past behavior of stock for the last 5-6 quarters suggest profit booking post result outcome (last quarter was exceptional). The corrective action generally comes in the range of 7-10% percent after result outcome.Palviya further added that post-correction of 15-20 days the stock bottoms out and demonstrated strong recovery and witnessed around 20-30% percent gain from the bottom made after results in 1-2 months.It took RIL 8-10 years to replicate its massive outperformance that we saw in the calendar year 2007. Most of the investors trapped then had to undergo massive time-wise pain, but now it looks like the pain is over and investors should eye big gains.RIL is in a strong bull run and investors who should hold onto the stock for bigger gains. It is one stock which should be part if your portfolio and any dips should be used as a buying opportunity.&ldquo;If we consider its ex-bonus price, a multi-year breakout point was around the 550 mark. The moment this stock surpassed this hurdle on a sustainable basis, we witnessed a beginning of strong &lsquo;Bull Run&rsquo;,&rdquo; Sameet Chavan, Chief Analyst- Technical Derivatives, Angel Broking Pvt Ltd told Moneycontrol.&ldquo;Considering the broader picture, there is no second thought whether the stock should be held in the portfolio or not. There is still a long way to go from here for this counter, but this will happen with a time,&rdquo; he said.We have collated a list of views from different experts on how to trade RIL ahead of results:Analyst: Mazhar Mohammad, Chief Strategist &ndash; Technical Research &amp;amp;amp; Trading Advisory, Chartviewindia.inAfter multi-year underperformance, this counter successfully aligned itself with the bull market frenzy as it broken out of a multi-year triangular formation couple of months back.Short term trading bets or even fresh positional longs should be considered only when this counter trades above Rs862 levels on closing basis in post result sessions.Any sell-off in this counter owing to weakness either in broader markets or disappointment on result front shall drag it down towards critical supports placed in the zone of Rs818 &ndash; 810 where long-term investors can enter.Analyst: Arpit Jain, AVP at Arihant Capital MarketsThe stock is showing some accumulation pattern on the longer term chart. Further, the weekly chart is still maintaining Higher &ndash; top Higher &ndash;bottom formation which is a sign of strength.The momentum indicators are positively poised. There strong demand at 800 &ndash; 780 levels.Hence one should hold the stock with a stop loss 779 for a target of 930 &ndash; 980 levels in a couple of weeks.Analyst: Pragnesh Jain, AVP Technical Research - Institutional Equities, Systematix sharesThe key resistance level is placed at Rs875 which can act as a hurdle. A breakout above Rs875 is required for further up-move after which it can extend upside to the extent of 915-930 zone where traders can look to book profits.Failure to breakout and sustain above Rs875 can see it slip back till Rs820-795 levels. Overall strong as long as 780 holds.Analyst: Rajesh Palviya, Head Technical &amp;amp;amp; Derivative Analyst, Axis Securities Ltd.Trading Strategy 1:&nbsp;Buy on a breakoutThe stock is in process of forming a Rectangular Pattern on the weekly chart and shown V shape recovery on daily chart in recent past, so if it manages to break out above Rs 870-875 one can buy the stock from a near-term trading perspective with a target of Rs 920-935 and stop-loss of Rs 845Trading Strategy 2:&nbsp;Buy on dipsLooking at the behavior of stock it corrects around 8-10% after results in next 10-15 days (only last quarter was exception), if the stock reacts negatively one can look for buying it around Rs 790-770 levels with a final stop-loss of Rs 740 to play for a pullback action with a target of Rs 870-880 in 1-2 months&rsquo; time frame.Trading Strategy 3:&nbsp;Short Sell if breaks below 835Looking at the near term chart reliance is having immediate support of 835 if stock breaks below 835 one can go short in stock with stop loss of 855 for lower side target of 790-770 in near/short term basis.Analyst: Sameet Chavan, Chief Analyst- Technical Derivatives, Angel Broking Pvt Ltd.As far as its activity around the &lsquo;Quarterly Result&rsquo; is concerned, there has been mixed reactions on 2 out 3 previous occasions. There is not much symmetry to think about.At present, the stock prices are trading way above its low (680.45) made after last &lsquo;Quarterly Result&rsquo; day and is still going strong as we saw the stock clocking fresh record high today.Investors can wait for dips to come or some kind of consolidation to happen and that&rsquo;s the only option left for them. As far as momentum traders are concerned, Thursday&rsquo;s close of Rs838 was quite encouraging and the stock may continue this rally in the near term.Disclosure: Reliance Industries Ltd. is the sole beneficiary of Independent Media Trust which controls Network18 Media &amp;amp;amp; Investments Ltd.

            "Under Modi, the world's third-biggest oil consumer is trying to use its market size to strike better deals with oil exporters and attract investment into India's exploration and refining industries. \n",
            "Prime Minister Narendra Modi sees scope for further reform of the country's energy sector and has received &amp;quot;focused suggestions&amp;quot; from some of the world's leading energy companies, the office of the premier said on Monday.Under Modi, the world's third-biggest oil consumer is trying to use its market size to strike better deals with oil exporters and attract investment into India's exploration and refining industries.Executives from companies including Rosneft, BP, Exxon Mobil, Reliance Industries, Saudi Aramco, Royal Dutch Shell, Vedanta, Schlumberger and Halliburton met Modi as the industry gathered in New Delhi for the three-day India Energy Forum, which finishes on Tuesday.&amp;quot;Participants appreciated the pace and drive with which Prime Minister Modi has brought about reform in the energy sector,&amp;quot; Modi's office said in a statement after the meeting.&amp;quot;Subjects such as the need for a unified energy policy, contract frameworks and arrangements, requirement of seismic data sets, encouragement for biofuels, improving gas supply, setting up of a gas hub and regulatory issues came up for discussion.&amp;quot;The statement said that many suggestions at the last meeting in 2016 have helped guide Indian policy-making and that Modi said he appreciated the &amp;quot;focused suggestions&amp;quot; made this year and that &amp;quot;scope for reform in many areas still exists&amp;quot;.Modi was quoted as saying he looked forward to &amp;quot;various opportunities&amp;quot; for cooperation between India and Saudi Arabia, the second biggest oil exporter to the country behind Iraq.State-run Saudi Aramco, which on Sunday launched a new office near New Delhi, is in talks with several Indian refiners for a possible joint venture by next year.Its Chief Executive Amin Nasser told the conference after the Modi meeting that India's oil demand would double by 2040 to about 10 million barrels per day, making it the world's largest market for the fuel and a priority for the company.In the meeting, Modi thanked Russian President Vladimir Putin and Rosneft for their support to India's energy sector. The two leaders were instrumental in helping to seal Rosneft's $12.9 billion acquisition of India's debt-laden Essar Oil, strengthening ties between the world's largest oil producer and the fastest-growing fuel consumer.In another vote of confidence for India's energy sector, BP and Reliance have previously said they would jointly invest $6 billion to boost India's gas output. A BP executive said on Monday that the company was &amp;quot;excited about gas, upstream and digital innovation in India&amp;quot;.Alay Patel, a senior analyst with consultancy Wood Mackenzie, the global president of which also met Modi, said that India's domestic energy production outlook was positive thanks to steps such as a simplified licensing regime and clarity on contracts.&amp;quot;But more is needed,&amp;quot; said Patel. &amp;quot;Allowing marketing and pricing freedom for all gas production, regardless of shore status and contract vintage would incentivise companies to develop gas in the less explored basins.&amp;quot;\n",

More than a year later, the government allowed higher natural gas price for yet-to-be-produced fields in difficult areas like deep sea.The government is looking at private investment to raise domestic oil and gas production, which has stagnated for the last few years while fuel demand has been rising by 5-6 per cent annually.India is dependent on imports to meet its 80 per cent of the demand and more than half of its natural gas requirements.The prime minister in 2015 had set a target of reducing India's oil dependence by 10 per cent to 67 per cent (based on import dependence of 77 per cent in 2014-15) by 2022.Import dependence has only increased since then and the government is now looking for ways to raise domestic output.OPEC Secretary General Mohammed Barkindo and Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan also attended the meeting. Former oil secretaries Vivek Rae and Vijay Kelkar were also invited for the meeting.Pradhan told the gathering that the liberalised India offers around USD 300 billion investment opportunity in the next 10 years in the oil and gas sector.&amp;quot;We want investors, both domestic and global, who can bring in the best technology and capital,&amp;quot; he said.The government is devising policies to increase share of gas in the energy basket to 15 per cent from 7 per cent.&amp;quot;We are planning a gas trading exchange and making sure there is open access to the gas grid. Global experience in this area would be useful,&amp;quot; he stated.According to Pradhan, in the last 40 months, the government has taken several policy initiatives in the energy sector in line with the prime minister's vision of energy access, efficiency, sustainability and security.Also present at the meeting were ONGC Chairman and Managing Director Shashi Shanker, Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) Chairman Sanjiv Singh, GAIL India head B C Tripathi, Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd (HPCL) Chairman Mukesh Kumar Suran, Oil India Chairman Utpal Bora and Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd (BPCL) Chairman D Rajkumar.\n",

            "Reliance Industries Ltd on Friday said it has sold one of its three shale gas assets in the US for USD 126 million, offloading stake in Marcellus, operated by Carrizo.RIL held stakes in three US shale gas ventures - 45 percent with Pioneer Natural Resources in the Eagle Ford shale play; 40 percent with Chevron and 60 percent with Carrizo Oil &amp;amp;amp; Gas in the Marcellus Shale play.Reliance Marcellus II, LLC, a subsidiary of Reliance Holding USA, Inc and RIL, signed agreements to &amp;quot;divest all of its interest in certain upstream assets in north-eastern and central Pennsylvania&amp;quot;, the company said in a statement.The assets, which are currently operated by Carrizo Oil &amp;amp;amp; Gas, Inc, were sold to BKV Chelsea, LLC, an affiliate of Kalnin Ventures LLC, for USD 126 million, subject to customary closing terms and conditions.Additionally, Reliance could receive contingent payments of up to USD 11.25 million in aggregate based on natural gas prices exceeding certain thresholds over the next three years.The assets produce mainly gas and are located in Susquehanna, Wyoming and Clearfield Counties of Pennsylvania.Walter Van de Vijver, President and CEO of Reliance Holding USA, Inc, said: &amp;quot;This transaction represents an opportunistic sale of developed upstream Marcellus assets and ends a successful partnership of 7 years with Carrizo in a joint sale.&amp;quot;RIL said it will continue to manage the remainder of its US shale resources.&amp;quot;Reliance remains invested in the Marcellus shale play via its non-operated position with Chevron in southwestern Pennsylvania and in the Eagle Ford play via its non-operated position with Pioneer in Texas,&amp;quot; the statement said.The transaction is anticipated to close by the end of the third quarter of 2017-18, with an April 1, 2017 effective date.Citigroup Global Markets, Inc acted as financial advisor to Reliance, Haynes and Boone served as its legal counsel.Disclaimer: Reliance Industries Ltd. is the sole beneficiary of Independent Media Trust which controls Network18 Media &amp;amp;amp; Investments Ltd\n",

            "We believe that 2HFY18 will see markets trading in a range with high volatility, says Hemang Jani, Head - Advisory, Sharekhan.\n",
            "The second half of FY18 will see a lot of challenges for the market with regards to geopolitical tensions, uncertainty on the domestic macroeconomic front, and strong economic vibes emanating from the US, Hemang Jani, Head, Advisory, Sharekhan said in an exclusive interview with Kshitij Anand of Moneycontrol.The 1HFY18 is over and the S&amp;amp;amp;P BSE Sensex rose just over 6 percent and for the year it has gained a little over 18 percent. Where do you see the markets headed in the next 6 months of this fiscal year?The 1HFY18 was historical as Nifty touched the 10,000 mark in July 2017. The first half of the financial year was almost on expected lines.But, the second half will see a lot of challenges for the market with regards to geopolitical tensions, uncertainty on the domestic macroeconomic front, and strong economic vibes emanating from the US which could turn the flow of capital away from emerging markets. We believe that 2HFY18 will see markets trading in a range with high volatility.Your list of top five stocks which could turn multibaggers in the next 2-3 years?Top five stocks which could turn multibaggers include stocks like Hindustan Unilever, Petronet LNG, Maruti Suzuki, NBCC &amp;amp;amp; Reliance Industries Ltd.Hindustan UnileverIn Q1FY2018, Hindustan Unilever Limited&rsquo;s (HUL) revenue and PAT grew by 5 percent on a YoY basis and 15 percent on a YoY basis, respectively, beating Street&rsquo;s expectations for the quarter.Sharekhan has already revised their earning estimates upwards for FY18 and FY19 by 2 percent and 3 percent, respectively, to factor in better-than-expected operating performance.The company is banking on operating efficiencies through various initiatives and cost-saving activities at the supply-chain/distribution level to see a gradual improvement in OPM.Petronet LNG (PLNG)Rebound in LNG imports and shutdown of Dabhol LNG terminal during the monsoon to improve PLNG&rsquo;s Dahej terminal utilization in Q2FY18. Sharekhan expects PLNG to be a key beneficiary of the rising share of LNG imports in India&rsquo;s overall gas consumption due to the following factors:1) Flat to a marginal increase in the domestic gas production outlook over FY18E-FY20E and, 2) Low competition in LNG market as only two new LNG terminals - 5mmt Mundra terminal and 5mmt Ennore terminal is expected to come on-stream over FY18E-FY20E.The stock is trading at an attractive valuation of 14.9x FY19E EPS given the strong earnings growth outlook (15 percent CAGR over FY17-2019E) and resilient RoE of 22-23 percent.Maruti SuzukiMaruti Suzuki India (Maruti) is India&rsquo;s largest passenger vehicle (PV) manufacturer with a strong 47 percent market share. Over the past two years, the company has been able to gain market share due to new product launches, a vast distribution network (with an increased focus on rural markets) and a shift in consumer preference to petrol models from diesel models.Maruti has successfully established itself in the big car category (Ciaz, Vitara Brezza, Dzire, and Baleno), led by strong product features and success of its premium distribution network Nexa, which offers a unique buying experience. Maruti continues to remain our top bet in the automotive space, given the sustained trend of outpacing the PV industry&rsquo;s growth.Reliance IndustriesSharekhan expects Reliance Industries's (RIL) GRM to remain strong at USD 11.5/12.0 per bbl in FY18/FY19, given the robust global oil demand growth outlook for 2017 at 1.5mbpd (International Energy Agency estimate).Moreover, a likely improvement in diesel cracks would help RIL to maintain a premium of USD 4bbl-5/ bbl over Singapore Complex GRM. Ethylene margin is also expected to remain firm at USD 600-650/mt, led by healthy demand and likely delay in the commissioning of incremental capacities in CY2018.It expects EBITDA/PAT CAGR of 23 percent/12 percent over FY17-FY19E, driven by the commissioning of core downstream projects in FY18. Any positive surprise in terms of better-than-expected financials of the telecom business would be an important re-rating trigger for RIL going forward.NBCCSharekhan marginally tweaked its earnings estimates on account of strong order inflow guidance and margin expansion despite flat topline in Q1. NBCC is likely to deliver an earnings CAGR of 51 percent during FY17-FY19E.The positive outlook on revenue guidance for the next two years is on account of revenue booking to kick-start from large projects of Nauroji Nagar, Netaji Nagar, and Sarojini Nagar. Backed by strong earnings visibility, a lean balance sheet, high return ratios and its quasi-monopoly position.Slipping macros is something which is troubling market participants at the current juncture. Do you think this will cap the upside for Indian markets or are these fears unfounded?If the slipping macros do not see signs of improvement especially with regards to taxation reforms (GST) then markets will have strong reasons to correct till things are well in place for the next leg of up-move.What is your call on the rupee? Do you see it heading towards Rs 70/USD in near term?If domestic macro factors do not improve and the US keeps its pace of improvement on the economic front, then we can see some migration of capital or fund flows from India and other emerging markets (EMs), which can result in high demand for US dollars resulting in the currency (rupee) touching the mentioned levels.September quarter earnings will kick off from the next month. Do you expect a recovery in earnings in this quarter?We expect certain pockets to do well this quarter. E.g. metals, auto, private banks. Till date, there are no strong hints of broader economic activity pick up; hence, there are reasons to believe that broader earnings will continue to remain subdued and below par.What is pushing foreign investors away from Indian markets? They have sold over Rs 20,000 crore in Indian equity markets in September (provisional).As mentioned above deteriorating domestic macro factors and no revival of earnings are driving the FIIs into other markets. This trend may continue in the near-term.Top sectors which will lead the next leg of the rally on India markets?Financials, automobiles, consumer discretionary &amp;amp;amp; rural franchise.(Disclosure: Reliance Industries Ltd. is the sole beneficiary of Independent Media Trust which controls Network18 Media &amp;amp;amp; Investments Ltd.)\n",

            "Drawing from the success of the revolutionary JioPhone (owned by Reliance Industries), handset maker Nokia may soon foray into the 4G feature phone market, various media reports quoted Ajay Mehta, India VP for HMD Global as saying.HMD Global is the company that develops and markets feature phones and smartphones under the Nokia brand name. The company has been operational since December 2016, after it bought Microsoft Mobile's feature phone business.The move follows the extraordinary success of Reliance's JioPhone, which has pushed other handset makers and telecom operators to work on lower-cost 4G LTE devices. At the moment, Lava, Intex, Idea and Airtel are all working on developing such devices.HMD Global is in talks with multiple telecom operators to collaborate for its plan. Although it has a number of feature phones in the Indian market already, none of the existing Nokia feature phones can function on 4G LTE only networks.&amp;quot;Feature phone is a critical category... and we see operators as a partner here. There is sizeable volume in this segment, roughly 10 million devices monthly. Nokia has traditionally been strong here, and there is huge opportunity,&amp;quot; Mehta told Times of India.The company recently launched the Nokia 8 smartphone in India, priced at Rs 36,999.

            "As the cartel of OPEC nations was trying to keep oil prices higher by deliberately cutting production, US oil fields were firing on all cylinders. \n",
            "Shishir AsthanaMoneycontrol ResearchAs the Very Large Crude Carrier (VLCC) docked at Paradip Port in Odisha on Monday to unload its 1.6 million barrels of shale oil, history was created. This was the first time since the US allowed exports of its oil after a ban of 40 years that it has&nbsp;supplied to India. But the move is significant in many other ways than just the symbolism attached to it.India and other Asian countries were dependent to a large extent on&nbsp;oil production in west Asia by the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC). Because of the proximity to Asian economies, these OPEC countries charged a premium for the oil they supplied.Taking into account that the cost of transportation from any other major oil producing countries would be prohibitive, OPEC countries got away with this. India has been raising the issue of the premium with OPEC countries over the last three years. Being the third-largest oil consumer, India demanded at a meeting of OPEC members and non-members that the premium be removed. The minister of petroleum and natural gas, Dharmendra Pradhan, said at the meeting that the global oil industry stood at a delicate crossroads and that any attempt to frustrate or assign lower importance to Indian demand would be detrimental to the suppliers.Explainer: How Daily Revision Of Petrol, Diesel Prices WorksWhile the OPEC nations were still deliberating on the action to be taken, India moved ahead by ordering its first consignment of 2 million barrels of shale oil for around USD 100 million. This move again was not just symbolic in order to put pressure on the OPEC countries, but it made economic sense, too.As the cartel of OPEC nations was trying to keep oil prices higher by deliberately cutting production, US oil fields were firing on all cylinders. As a result of higher supply, the spread between Dubai Oil and those from Brent and WTI (West Texas Intermediate) fields fell in favour of the western oil fields. This made importing oil from the US cheaper than those from west Asia.The government played an important role in bringing transportation costs down as it eased restrictions on importing oil compulsorily through ships owned by Indian companies. Using a VLCC to transport oil reduced the cost of transportation and made the decision economically viable.The refiner, in this case, Indian Oil Corporation (IOC), benefited not only from the lower price of crude but also from a better quality of the oil. Shale oil, also known as tight oil, gives the best yield for the most lucrative middle distillates. In other words, the gross refining margins (GRM) of refineries will improve if the shale oil is used. Little wonder then that Reliance Industries too has booked 1 million barrels of WTI and Eagle Ford crude each.Finally, the geopolitical benefit that India gains by purchasing US crude also needs to be taken into account. The deal to buy US oil was struck in a meeting between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and US President Donald Trump. For India, importing crude oil also helps in bringing down the USD 24-billion trade deficit which Trump has been pointing to in his attack on India&rsquo;s impact on US jobs.In the context of around 1,500 million barrels of oil imported by India, the present import is too small to move the needle, but it is surely going to turn heads in the OPEC world as the cartel struggles to find new markets and environmental awareness puts pressure on oil demand.(Disclosure : Reliance Industries Ltd. is the sole beneficiary of Independent Media Trust which controls Network18 Media &amp;amp;amp; Investments Ltd.)For more research articles, visit our&nbsp;Moneycontrol Research Page.\n",

            "Reliance Industries Ltd has purchased crude oil cargoes from the United States for the first time, drawn by the lower price for U.S. oil versus global benchmarks, three trade sources said on Tuesday.Reliance, the owner of the world's biggest refining complex at Jamnagar, is joining state-run refiners Indian Oil Corp , Bharat Petroleum Corp and Hindustan Petroleum Corp in importing US crude. The purchase illustrates the vast reach of U.S. oil exports since the government rescinded a decades-long ban at the end of 2015.For this purchase, Reliance bought 1 million barrels of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) Midland and a similar-sized cargo of Eagle Ford crude, both of which are expected to arrive in November, the sources said.U.S. producer Occidental Petroleum Corp sold the WTI Midland cargo, they said.Reliance did not respond to Reuters' email seeking comments.There was also no reply to an emailed request for comment from Occidental sent outside of U.S. business hours.Opportunities for Indian refiners to import more U.S. crude increased after the discount for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark for U.S. crude, to global benchmark Brent stretched to its widest since 2015 during September.Explainer: How Daily Revision Of Petrol, Diesel Prices WorksState-run Indian refiners have bought a total 7.85 million barrels of oil from the United States so far.India's imports of U.S. oil follows Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to Washington in June when President Donald Trump said his country looked forward to exporting more energy products to India.On Monday, Indian Oil, the country's top refiner, received its parcel of the U.S. crude at the eastern port of Paradip, the company said in a statement.Including the U.S. as a source for crude imports for refiners will go a long way in mitigating the risk arising from geo-political disruptions, Sanjay Sudhir, the joint secretary for international cooperation at the oil ministry, said in the Indian Oil statement.U.S. crude oil shipments to India have the potential to boost bilateral trade by up to $2 billion, the U.S. embassy in India said in a statement on Monday.Reliance Industries Ltd. is the sole beneficiary of Independent Media Trust which controls Network18 Media &amp;amp;amp; Investments Ltd\n",

            "In May, RIL had become the first buyer of gas it produced from its own coal bed methane (CBM) block in Madhya Pradesh after agreeing to pay the highest price of USD 4.23 per million British thermal unit (mmBtu) for May-June.\n",
            "Reliance Industries has outbid rivals, including state-owned GAIL India, to buy the entire volume of natural gas from its own coal seam blocks until March 2021.In May, RIL had become the first buyer of gas it produced from its own coal bed methane (CBM) block in Madhya Pradesh after agreeing to pay the highest price of USD 4.23 per million British thermal unit (mmBtu) for May-June.In the following quarter, it paid an additional 6 per cent at USD 4.50 per mmBtu to take all of the CBM gas from Sohagpur East and Sohagpur West blocks.In the latest bidding for up to 3 million standard cubic metres per day (mmscmd) of gas to be produced during October 2017 and March 2021, RIL quoted USD 6.26 per mmBtu at the current oil price, according to bid documents.Piramal Glass was the second-highest bidder quoting USD 4.97 per mmBtu, followed by Gujarat State Petroleum Corporation (GPSC) putting in a bid of USD 4.9.GAIL bid for 1.5 mmscmd of gas at a price of USD 4.63 per mmBtu while its subsidiary GAIL Gas sought an equivalent quantity at USD 4.11 per mmBtu price, the bid document showed.RIL plans to use the gas at its petrochemical plants in Gujarat and Maharashtra, which run mostly on expensive imported fuel.Its petrochemical plants at Patalganga and Nagothane in Maharashtra and Vadodara and Jamnagar in Gujarat consumed an average of 4 mmscmd of gas during the last three months.RIL started commercial gas production from the CBM blocks in March and the planned output in October is 0.8 mmscmd, according to the bid document.Output would be ramped up to 2 mmscmd by March 2018 while the peak production of 3 mmscmd would touch in the third quarter of 2018.The rate of CBM gas is 150 per cent more than the government mandated USD 2.48 per mmBtu price of the conventional natural gas produced by firms such as ONGC and RIL from the eastern offshore KG-D6 block.The bidding formula in all the three bid rounds for CBM gas this year has been the same and the process has been conducted by Crisil Risk and Infrastructure Solutions, a unit of Crisil.This formula is almost similar to the one RIL had run in 2012 to discover a price for CBM gas. Back in 2012, it had sought bids for 3.5 mmscmd of coal gas at the benchmarked rate of 12.67 per cent of JCC, or Japan Customs-Cleared Crude, plus USD 0.26 per mmBtu.The formula was the same at which Petronet LNG, a joint venture of public oil companies, whose chairman is the oil secretary, used to buy long-term liquefied natural gas (LNG) from Qatar.At USD 100 per barrel oil price prevalent that year, CBM from RIL's Madhya Pradesh block was to cost USD 12.93 per mmBtu. At USD 58 a barrel rate currently, it would have cost USD 7.3. That formula was, however, rejected by the ministry even though 59 valid bids seeking about 70 mmscmd of gas were received in the open tender.In the current price discovery, RIL sought bids in the form of a deductible from 12.67 per cent of prevailing Brent crude oil price plus USD 0.52 per mmBtu plus USD 0.26 per mmBtu, according to the bid document.RIL bid deducting USD 1.836 per mmBtu and Piramal Glass USD 3.156. GAIL quoted a deduction of USD 3.495. RIL has invested about USD 500 million in CBM and laying a 300-km pipeline from Sohagpur to Phulpur in Uttar Pradesh to connect to the national gas grid.Through an April 13 notification, the oil ministry had stated that a CBM producer had to call for open bids for sale of coal gas and seek quotes to discover the market price.Disclaimer: Reliance Industries Ltd. is the sole beneficiary of Independent Media Trust which controls Network18 Media &amp;amp;amp; Investments Ltd.\n",

            "Moneycontrol NewsSpeaking at inaugural India Mobile Congress, Reliance Industries chairman Mukesh Ambani highlighted the achievements&nbsp;of telecom sector in India and put emphasis on collectively using the new technology and data revolution to tap the potential of human capital which India possesses.Here are 10 key takeaways from his speech:1. In last one year, India became the largest data consuming country from 155th in mobile broadband penetration. The pace at which India has grown is unparalleled in the world.2. Ambani estimated that in the next ten years the Indian economy will grow to USD 7 trillion from current USD 2.5 trillion and rank among top three economies in the world.3. He said, as a nation, we missed out three industrial revolution&mdash;mechanisation, mass production and automation. However, the fourth industrial revolution has begun and India has an opportunity to lead.4. Mobile internet and cloud computing are foundations of the fourth industrial revolution. Data is the new oil and we do not need to import it. We have it in abundance. It will help in creating prosperity and opportunities for India and 1.3 billion Indians.5. Data is the oxygen of a new digital economy. We cannot deprive Indians of this life-sustaining resource. We have to ensure that we connect everyone with an affordable smartphone so that they can access limitless knowledge.6. Ambani stated three must-do tasks for government and industry: One, we must explore and implement innovative ideas for employment and income generation abilities. &ldquo;We must foster confidence in the society that new technologies&mdash;robotics, cloud computing, Internet of Things the blockchain, nanotechnology, 3-D printing, etc.&mdash; are enablers of employment and wealth. We need to tap these technologies to generate jobs,&rdquo; he said.8. Second, digital technology can be a boon for achieving national priorities such as water security, energy security and resource security. India must embark on the task of connecting everything and everyone with the Internet of Things.9. Third, nation&rsquo;s human capital our greatest asset. Therefore, digitisation of education, skill training and human resource development in a comprehensive manner is vital to the&nbsp;success of Digital India. Telecom industry will have to be part of this mission.10. He concluded his speech by saying that to achieve Prime Minister&rsquo;s dream of Digital India, we all have to chip in.

The NSE midcap and small-cap indices have rallied 12% and 16%, respectively, from their August lows and hit new highs ahead of the benchmark.Going forward, we expect the benchmark to catch up with the broader markets and extend the ongoing up move with banking, auto, and capital goods sector leading the current up move.We believe the immediate support base for the index has shifted upwards to 9900 regions being the confluence of lower band of the expanding channel in place since April 2017 and the value of rising 50 days EMA currently placed at 9900 levels.Here is a list of top five stocks which could give up to 21% upside in 6 months:Reliance Industries: BUY| Target Rs942| Stop Loss Rs798| upside 11%| Time Frame 6 monthThe oil &amp;amp;amp; gas space has emerged as the major dark horse in the market wide up move over the last one year. The sector which had remained a prominent laggard since the downturn of 2008 has witnessed change fortunes and is back on investors&rsquo; radar as it has actively participated in the ongoing up move.The BSE oil &amp;amp;amp; gas index rose to an all-time high in April 2017. The oil &amp;amp;amp; gas behemoth Reliance Industries has also witnessed a major turnaround in long-term price structure as it has catapulted past its previous lifetime high of |820 (adjusted for bonus) after a gap of nine long years.After testing the previous life high in August 2017, the stock consolidated below the same over last one month. We believe this higher base building process has acted as a launch pad for the eventual thrust past the previous life high.The share price has emerged out of long-term hibernation by decisively conquering its 2008 life high of |820 in the current month thereby triggering a bullish structural turnaround on the long-term price chart.The entire up move since January 2017 till date has occurred in a well-defined rising channel highlighting a structured up move and sustained demand at elevated levels. The stock took support at the lower band of this rising channel during the August consolidation.The up move in the current week has seen the stock register a breakout from one-month consolidation and in the process decisively closed above its 2008 highs. We believe the stock has concluded its long-term consolidation phase and is set to embark upon its fresh uptrend and offers good investment opportunity from a medium-term horizon.We expect the stock to enter into a sustainable uptrend and head towards Rs944 over the medium term. The price wise equality with the last rising segment (Rs643 to 827 = 184 points) added to the base of August 2017 consolidation (760+184=944) projects upside towards Rs944 for the current up move over the medium term.Disclaimer: Reliance Industries Ltd. is the sole beneficiary of Independent Media Trust which controls Network18 Media &amp;amp;amp; Investments Ltd.Punjab National Bank: BUY| Target Rs170| Stop Loss Rs129| Upside 19%| Time Frame Six monthsThe share price of PNB is attractively poised near the key value area providing a good entry opportunity with favourable risk/reward from a medium-term perspective. The corrective decline from 52 weeks high of Rs185 in May 2017 got anchored near the key value area of Rs135 in June 2017.The stock bounced back to Rs164 level in July 2017 before once again revisiting the support zone in August 2017. Over the last five weeks the stock is undergoing a base formation precisely above the key value area of Rs135 which is the confluence of following:The lower band of rising channel marking equality with November-December 2016 fall is placed at Rs135. Rising 52 week EMA is currently placed around Rs142, 61.8% retracement of the last rising segment is also placed around Rs139 levels.The two distinct lows formed in June and August 2017 near Rs135 levels represents a bullish Double Bottom formation precisely at the major value area.It indicates steady demand emerging above the key support zone ahead of the impending reversal on the price front. The base formation over the last five weeks has laid the foundation for the next up move.Therefore, we believe the stock is attractively poised above its key value area and offers good buying opportunity with a favourable risk/reward to ride the next up move over the medium termWe expect the stock to resolve higher from here on and retrace the May-June 2017 decline by at least 80 percent over the coming month thereby providing upside towards Rs175 region over the medium term horizon.Asian Granito: BUY| Target Rs615| Stop Loss Rs457| Upside 21%| Time Frame 6 monthsThe share price of Asian Granito India has remained in a secular uptrend since May 2014 as it continues to form a higher peak and higher trough in all time frames.Within this structural uptrend, the stock has undergone periodic phases of consolidation providing fresh entry opportunities for investors to ride the uptrend.We believe the sideways consolidation over the last 10 weeks has approached maturity and the stock provides a good entry opportunity with a favourable reward/risk set up for medium-term investors to ride the next up move within the larger uptrend.The stock witnessed a strong rally in June-July 2017 rallying from a low of Rs333 to its all-time high of Rs500 in just 7 weeks. Thereafter, the sideways consolidation over last ten week has taken the pictorial shape of a bullish rounding formation as highlighted in the adjoining weekly chart.The stock is currently at the cusp of the rounding pattern breakout thus offers fresh entry opportunity to ride the next up move in the stockThe key observation of price action reveals that the rallies since March 2017 has become bigger in magnitude than the preceding up move as the up move during June 2017 from Rs 333 to Rs500 (Rs500-333=167 points) was bigger in magnitude than the preceding rally of March 2017 (| 277-392=115 points).On a similar basis, the current rally from August 2017 low of Rs380 is likely to be larger in magnitude than the preceding up move of 167 points. The price rallies getting bigger and swifter is a hallmark of the bull phase and corroborates the bullish view on the stock.We expect the stock to continue with its current uptrend and head towards Rs620 in the medium term as it is the measuring implication of the rounding formation being the width of the pattern ( 500-380=120 points) added to the neckline of the rounding formation thus projects upside towards Rs620Oberoi Realty: BUY| Target Rs615| Stop Loss Rs402| Return 10% Time Frame 6 monthsThe most prominent pattern on the weekly chart of Oberoi Realty is the breakout from Bullish Triangular consolidation pattern, which triggers fresh upward momentum and offers the opportunity to ride the next up leg.The share price has remained in a sustained uptrend as marked by rising peak and trough formation and one of the outperforming stocks within realty space. The recent consolidation post-May 2017 peak of| 416 is anchored upon long-term 52-week EMA and took the form of a bullish triangular continuation pattern.In early September, the share price broke out of this triangular pattern (Rs416-335). A subsequent retest of the breakout (Rs395) during last week, in the form of incremental buying support, corroborates the breakout and, thus, the bullish stance.We have projected the target of Rs466 over the next three months based on pattern implication of the Triangle continuation pattern. The range of largest leg of Triangle (416-335=81 points) as projected from the breakout level of | 395 (395+81=476) is projected at Rs 476Disclaimer: The author is Head Technical, AVP at ICICI Direct.com Research.

            "Reliance may expand the capacity at its dual refinery complex in Jamnagar in Gujarat by 30 million tonnes a year to 100 million tonnes per year, according to the sources. \n",
            "The Reliance Industries, operator of the world's largest refining complex, is considering expanding its oil processing capacity by over 40 percent by 2030, according to two sources familiar with the matter.Reliance may expand the capacity at its dual refinery complex in Jamnagar in Gujarat by 30 million tonnes a year to 100 million tonnes per year, according to the sources, who saw the expansion plans in a presentation by the company on potential energy scenarios to 2030.Reliance made the presentation to India's Center for High Technology (CHT), a unit of the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas that evaluates projects and assesses their technological requirements.The plans signal that Reliance remains bullish on the outlook for India's fuel demand even as the government is considering plans to electrify all of the country's vehicles by 2032. Still, India's demand for diesel and gasoline to power existing and expecting combustion engine vehicles will likely remain strong as its population grows and becomes more wealthy.&amp;quot;The plan to is to have petrol and diesel output capacity of close to 60 million tonnes by 2030, produced from cheaper heavy grades,&amp;quot; said one of the sources.Reliance did not respond to an emailed request for a comment on the possible expansion.Reliance operates two refineries at the Jamnagar complex with an installed capacity of 1.2 million barrels per day (bpd), or 60 million tonnes per year.The plants typically operate above their installed capacity and process 1.4 million bpd of crude, or about 70 million tonnes per year. The refineries are among the most complex in the world and have facilities that can maximize the production of diesel and gasoline from so-called heavy, or higher density, crude oil that typically sells for less than other crude grades.Raising the refining capacity at the Jamnagar complex to 100 million tonnes per year would equal about 2 million bpd.The expansion makes sense in light of forecasts for strong fuel demand growth in the country, the world's third-biggest oil consumer. Consultant FGE estimates India's fuel demand to rise to 6.5 million bpd in 2030 from an estimated 4.2 million bpd in 2017.Although, Reliance has not yet prepared a blueprint for the expansion and details of the costs are yet to be worked out, it would require around USD 10 billion to complete the plan, said the one source.In 2014, Reuters reported that Reliance was planning a 400,000 bpd expansion at the Jamnagar site. That plan is yet to be approved by the environment ministry, according to the ministry website.Disclaimer:&nbsp;Reliance Industries Ltd. is the sole beneficiary of Independent Media Trust which controls Network18 Media &amp;amp;amp; Investments Ltd.\n",

            "Reliance Jio made several records not only in India but across the globe and crossed 130 million customers mark in one year of its operations, Reliance Industries Chairman and MD Mukesh Ambani said in his letter to employees.&amp;quot;In this past one year, we have broken several records, both in India and globally. But what gives me the biggest personal satisfaction is to have broken the myth that India is not ready to adopt advanced technology,&amp;quot; Ambani said in his letter to Jio employees.Reliance Jio launched its mobile services commercially on September 5 last year, with 90 days of unlimited 4G data free along with free unlimited voice calling and access to services during roaming at no additional cost for lifetime.India telecom sector touched its peak subscriber addition in the subsequent month when Jio commenced operation.India's telecom subscriber base crossed the 1.1 billion mark in October, registering highest customer addition of around 29 million in a month. Out of this, the new entrant alone added 19.63 million subscribers.Appreciating effort of the employees, Ambani said, &amp;quot;the way you laid out the infrastructure and technology and most importantly, the way you worked tirelessly to have more than hundred and thirty million satisfied customers, making Jio a truly customer obsessed organisation&amp;quot;.As per Trai data, Jio had 123.36 million subscribers at the end of June.A senior Jio official said during one of Jio's service, mobile data consumption in India went up from 20 crore GB per month to over 150 crore GB per month with Jio customers alone are consuming 125 crore GB.&amp;quot;India moved up from 155 to number 1 in the world in terms of mobile data consumption. Jio has become the world's first and only exabyte telecom network with more than 100 crore GB data per month being accessed on its network. Jio is already carrying five times more data than all other telecom players put together in India,&amp;quot; the official said.Ambani in the letter said that the way country has embraced 4G technology and the way it is being used has become case study for quantum technology leaps.With the launch of Jio services, the cost of 1 GB mobile data has come down to less than Rs 10 from around Rs 250 priced earlier by other telecom operators.&amp;quot;Together we have created the largest end-to-end all -IP 4G network in the world...India has adopted Jio as its own. This is also reflected in the gigantic spurt in data consumption and customer numbers on our network,&amp;quot; Ambani said.RIL group firm Reliance Retail has recently unveiled first mobile phone, JioPhone, which it will provide effectively for free against refundable deposit of Rs 1,500 a unit. As per channel partners of Reliance Retail over 6 million JioPhone units have been booked in period of just 3 days.

            "OPINION-A year on since last Teacher&rsquo;s Day, there are lessons from Reliance Jio&rsquo;s progress\n",
            "In no market in the world do the incumbents change the rule of the game but nor does a challenger set the rules in a manner Reliance did.\n",
            "Dhirendra TripathiMoneycontrol NewsIt&rsquo;s Teacher&rsquo;s Day, as it was last year when Reliance Jio Infocomm launched its mobile services. Since then, voice has had a silent revolution (it&rsquo;s gone almost free) and data a noisy one (not free but bet it&rsquo;s never been cheaper). In no market in the world do the incumbents change the rule of the game but nor does a challenger set the rules in a manner Reliance did. Ever heard a 30-year-old established company accusing a Johnny-cum-lately of unfair trade?In this passage of 365 days, the history of the country&rsquo;s mobile services industry has undergone some rewriting. The enormity of the numbers takes time to get one&rsquo;s head around. Even putting comparisons aside &ndash; most of them lose relevance -- their absolute size and scale are noteworthy.A customer can talk endlessly today and use 1GB of data every day for a monthly spend of less than Rs 135. Successive reports by the telecom regulator have put Jio&rsquo;s data speeds ahead of its rivals&rsquo;.One points out that data used to cost Rs 250 per GB before the Reliance Jio launch and comes for less than Rs 50 today. But the story doesn&rsquo;t end there. Data prices have not only crashed but the entire economics of data pricing has been disturbed for good. Call up a service centre of any incumbent and one can virtually bargain for any amount of data at rock-bottom tariffs. Tariff plans be damned: Now it&rsquo;s as if they can be totally customised.At the customer end, two key steps went right for Jio. To begin with, customers appreciated the smooth experience they had at the time of taking a Jio connection &ndash; no documents, no photos but an Aadhaar ID was all that was needed. Post-connection verification was thus rendered irrelevant. Online recharging and various apps made it all the more pleasant. A foundation for a string of records that would be set in the coming months was thus laid.The Reliance Industries subsidiary notched up 100 million subscribers within 170 days of its launch &ndash; translating into nearly 7 customers joining the company&rsquo;s platform every single second -- a feat achieved nowhere in the world. As on date, the company has over 130 million subscribers.While Reliance Jio remains the most competitive in terms of quality of network and pricing, its entry has helped its rivals to buck up. Data speeds on every platform have improved and most are now talking of moving to a 4G network in a year or so. As a result, all industry metrics have undergone a change, the consumer being the ultimate beneficiary. Average post-paid monthly mobile bills are down by Rs 80-100. Industry average revenue per user fell Rs 10 quarter-on-quarter to Rs 131 in January-March.Records in an industry, like in sports, are meant to be broken but some are difficult to break and some are just impossible. Take this one. Before the Jio launch, India was number 155 in terms of mobile data consumption by its citizens. A year later, India consumes more data than any other country in the world. In August 2016, data consumed in India was 20 crore GB per month. That number stands revised to 150 crore GB, a seven-and-a-half-fold jump. Talk of Indians&rsquo; appetite for data.The company last month also launched JioPhone, a 4G feature phone, but had to stop taking further bookings within 5 days of their August 24 opening. In an industry first, the company will after three years refund the entire Rs 1,500 it is taking for the sale of phones. Voice calling on the JioPhone will always be free, according to the company. The delivery of phones for the initial set of bookings is expected to start this month.The impact of Reliance Jio has gone beyond the consumer, pricing and consumption side of the industry. It has forced its rivals -- still much bigger &ndash; to rethink and revise their plans. It led to the UK-based giant Vodafone watering down its commitment to India. It is currently in the throes of merging its Indian unit with Idea Cellular where the multinational company will initially hold 45 percent stake against Idea&rsquo;s 35 percent with both the partners eventually holding equal stake in the combined entity.A planned merger between Reliance Communications and Aircel is also underway. There is speculation of Bharti Airtel acquiring Tata Teleservices though doubts linger on that deal fructifying.Number 2 and 3 combine to become number 1 and the old number 1 also goes shopping because the number 4 is just too much. An infant did teach the daddies a thing or two.

            "The entry of a formidable player like Reliance Jio has turned the Indian telecommunication industry upside down. Jio&rsquo;s freebies have intensified the price war leading to a steady decline in average revenue per user (ARPU) -- an important metric for telecommunication players.\n",
            "Nitin AgrawalMoneycontrol ResearchThe entry of a formidable player like Reliance Jio has turned the Indian telecommunication industry upside down. Jio&rsquo;s freebies have intensified the price war leading to a steady decline in average revenue per user (ARPU) -- an important metric for telecommunication players.The intensity of the competition is being felt by the debt-laden incumbents, evident from their latest results compared to last year's. Industry dynamics will change drastically.What does the latest TRAI data suggest?Recently, TRAI (Telecom Regulatory Authority of India) published financial data pertaining to gross revenues, adjusted gross revenues (AGR) and other parameters for the quarter ended June 2017. The data did not surprise us as it&nbsp;reflected the pain that incumbents have been highlighting.For the understanding of our readers, AGR is calculated from gross revenues after adjusting for charges paid to other service providers, roaming revenues actually paid to other service providers, and service and sales tax paid to the government. Adjusted gross revenue ARPU is calculated by dividing AGR by the number of users and this is a measure of spending on telecom services per customer.Competition shrinking the overall pieTelecommunication industry witnessed a significant decline of 13 percent (YoY) in gross revenues and 27 percent decline in AGR. The fall indicates that the customers are paying less for the services, primarily led by steep discounts offered by Jio and the response of the incumbents to these offers.ARPUs decline continuesIndustry AGR ARPU also fell by 36 percent (YoY) and 7 percent (QoQ). It currently stands at Rs 80. A sequential fall in AGR ARPU indicates that the price war is far from over. In fact, we believe that the launch of the JioPhone might hurt incumbents further.AGR for the top 3 players (Bharti Airtel, Idea and Vodafone) fell by 22 percent (YoY) in the quarter gone by and their ARPU fell by 28 percent (YoY) to Rs113.Bharti &ndash; performance indicators not lending comfortBharti Airtel&rsquo;s AGR fell 23 percent (YoY) to Rs 99 billion. However, it could gain 175 bps (YoY) in AGR market share on the back of 300bps market share gains in 900MHz circles. Airtel also witnessed a 30 percent (YoY) fall in its ARPU.Idea and Vodafone &ndash; gaining market share at the cost of profitabilityIdea also witnessed a 21 percent (YoY) fall in its AGR. The fall was lower than Airtel on the back of higher conversion of AGR from gross revenue, perhaps with more calls landing in their own network. Idea&rsquo;s AGR market share witnessed an uptick of 165bps (YoY). However, ARPU for Idea continued the downward trend with 29 percent (YoY) fall and stood at Rs 105.Vodafone also posted a similar set of numbers. It witnessed a steep fall of 21 percent (YoY) in its AGR and 26 percent in ARPU. However, Vodafone&rsquo;s gain of AGR market share was higher than Airtel and Idea. It rose by 180bps (YoY) and 60bps (QoQ) on the back of improved market share in the established circles.Vodafone and Idea together have close to 46.8 percent AGR market share, much higher than the current leader, Airtel.Jio- still in redJio&rsquo;s AGR stood at a negative Rs 10 billion led by payment of Rs 21.5 billion access and other charges. Any decision to lower IUC (Interconnection Usage Charges) &ndash; the charges paid to the other networks to complete calls -- would be a big boost to its business. Jio&rsquo;s AGR market share is also negative and currently stands at a negative 3.7 percent.Will Jio&rsquo;s monetisation efforts help the industry?The good news for the industry is that after intensifying the price war by providing freebies, Jio is now moving towards monetising its customer base, which stands at 123 million at the end of June-2017 (up from 108.9 million in March 2017). It is likely to adopt a balanced approach between revenue growth and subscriber additions.The company has recently outlined new plans wherein it has reduced the validity indicating an uptick in ARPU (average revenue per user). The most prominent plan of Rs399 for 84 days validity translates into an ARPU of close to Rs 124, up from Rs 94 based on the earlier plan (Rs 309 for 84 days).The price war has already eliminated the marginal players. With the stronger entities left in the fray, the industry can look forward to a relatively more rational competition, although not before a couple of more years of turbulence.(Disclosure : Reliance Industries is the sole beneficiary of Independent Media Trust which controls Network18 Media &amp;amp;amp; Investments Ltd)Follow @agrawant\n",

            "The Production Sharing Contract (PSC) allows RIL and its partners BP Plc of the UK and Canada's Niko Resources to deduct all capital and operating expenses from the sale of gas before sharing profit with the government.\n",
            "The government has imposed a new penalty of USD 264 million (about Rs 1,700 crore) on Reliance Industries Ltd and its partners for producing less than the targeted natural gas from eastern offshore KG-D6 fields in 2015-16.The total penalty now, which is in the form of disallowing recovery of cost incurred for missing the target during six years beginning April 1, 2010, stands at USD 3.02 billion, an oil ministry official said.The Production Sharing Contract (PSC) allows RIL and its partners BP Plc of the UK and Canada's Niko Resources to deduct all capital and operating expenses from the sale of gas before sharing profit with the government.Disallowing costs will result in government's profit share rising.The government has claimed an additional USD 175 million as its profit share after the cost disallowance, the official said.Gas production from Dhirubhai-1 and 3 gas field in the eastern offshore KG-D6 block was supposed to be 80 million standard cubic meters per day but actual production was only 35.33 mmscmd in 2011-12, 20.88 mmscmd in 2012-13 and 9.77 mmscmd in 2013-14. The output has continued to drop in the subsequent years and is now below 4 mmscmd.Emails sent to RIL and BP remained unanswered.The two companies have challenged the cost disallowance of the past years and have initiated an international arbitration seeking dropping of the same on grounds that the PSC does not provide for any such punishment.The government had for 2010-11 disallowed USD 457 million of cost, USD 548 million for 2011-12, USD 792 million for 2012-13, USD 579 million for 2013-14 and USD 380 million for 2014-15.Now an additional USD 264 million has been disallowed for output lagging behind target in 2015-16.The output was behind target in 2016-17 as well and the cost disallowance will be calculated only next year, the official said.RIL had previously stated that &amp;quot;every year, based on its own interpretations of the PSC and assumptions (with which the contractor group does not agree), the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas revises the total cost it proposes to disallow and consequently aggregates the figure with figures of the previous years.&amp;quot;It also demands additional profit petroleum (in total including previous year claims as well) as Government of India share&amp;quot;.Of the additional profit petroleum claimed, the government has already collected gross USD 81.7 million in the gas pool account by taking away any gas price higher than USD 4.2 per million British thermal unit during November 2014 to March 2016 period.From April 2016 to date, the gas price has been less than USD 4.2 and no deposits were made to the gas pool account.Contractor group refers to RIL and its partners BP and Niko.RIL holds 60 percent interest in block KG-DWN-98/3 or KG-D6 in Bay of Bengal. BP has 30 percent and Niko the remaining 10 percent.Disclosure:&nbsp;&ldquo;Reliance Industries Ltd. is the sole beneficiary of Independent Media Trust which controls Network18 Media &amp;amp;amp; Investments Ltd.&rdquo;\n",

            "Reliance Industries and its partner BP Plc of UK will by year end submit a revised investment plan for the four satellite gas discoveries in the flagging KG-D6 block by integrating their development with two other nearby finds.Senior executives in the joint venture said four deepsea satellite gas discoveries -- D&mdash;2, 6, 19 and 22 are planned to be developed together with D29 and D30 finds in the Krishna Godavari basin of KG-D6 block.The four satellites and the other two finds (D29 and D30), R-Series and MJ gas discoveries, are the ones on which RIL and BP had in mid-June this year announced investing Rs 40,000 crore to reserve the flagging production from KG-D6 block.They said development of the six satellite finds are being taken up together while D-34 or R-Series and D-55 (MJ) would have separate development plans.The government had in 2012 approved a USD 1.529 billion plan to produce 10.36 million standard cubic meters per day of gas from four satellite fields of block KG-DWN-98/3 (KG&mdash;D6) by 2016-17.The four fields have 617 billion cubic feet of reserves and can produce gas for eight years.However, the companies did not begin the investment citing uncertainty over gas pricing.Now that the government has allowed a higher gas price of USD 5.56 per million British thermal unit for yet-to-be- developed gas finds in difficult areas like the deepsea, RIL and BP have decided to take up their development.This rate is comparable with USD 2.48 per mmBtu for currently producing fields.The executives said these four finds are now been clubbed together with D29 and D30 discoveries, which had been held up over conformity tests.They however did not give investment numbers saying a slump in global energy prices and services market will only see lesser amount of money being spent.RIL-BP combine do not plan to alter the USD 3.18 billion investment plan for D-34 or R-Series gas field in the same block, which was approved in August 2013.About 12.9 mmscmd of gas for 13 years can be produced from from D-34 discovery, which is estimated to hold recoverable reserves of 1.4 trillion cubic feet.A separate development plan for the MJ find would be submitted by mid-2018, they said.RIL has so far made 19 gas discoveries in the KG&mdash;D6 block. Of these, D&mdash;1 and D&mdash;3 &mdash;&mdash; the largest among the lot &mdash;&mdash; were brought into production from April, 2009, but output has fallen sharply from 54 mmscmd in March, 2010, to 3-4 mmscmd.MJ is the only other field that was put to production. Together, the three fields today produce 6.4 mmscmd.Other discoveries have either been surrendered or taken away by the government for not meeting timelines for beginning production.&ldquo;Reliance Industries Ltd. is the sole beneficiary of Independent Media Trust which controls Network18 Media &amp;amp;amp; Investments Ltd.&rdquo;\n",

            "FIIs add HDFC Bank and ICICI Bank, but sell Infosys.\n",
            "Institutions across the board &ndash; both domestic and foreign &ndash; continued to pick up Indian stocks in the June quarter. Strategists are calling this institutionalizing of Indian equities, as the largest category of shareholders (promoters) bring down their stakes, while large financial institutions increase their stakes.For 12 straight quarters, domestic mutual funds have been buying Indian equities, which has taken their ownership levels to 5.7 percent (up 44 basis points), the highest ever since 2001.Other financial institutions banks and insurance &ndash;now own 7.6 percent of Indian equities, up 8 basis points sequentially. Foreign institutional ownership too hit an all-time high of 27.5 percent in the June quarter, up 59 basis points, sequentially.According to Morgan Stanley&rsquo;s analysis of institutional ownership in the June quarter, &ldquo;HDFC Bank and ICICI Bank saw the most buying by foreign portfolio investors, while Infosys saw the most selling. The largest overweight is HDFC Bank, and the largest underweights are Reliance Industries and Infosys. Domestic mutual funds bought ICICI Bank the most and sold Larsen &amp;amp;amp; Toubro the most. Overall, institutions bought ICICI Bank the most and sold Infosys the most.&rdquo;Institutions across the board have shown their preference for financials in the June quarter as they are overweight on the sector. Institutions are underweight on healthcare and technology sectors, given that both sectors face structural headwinds. This is in contrast to the pattern seen last year where institutions were seen to be adding staples, healthcare and technology, while reducing financials, energy and materials.At the end of June, institutions (banks, mutual funds and foreign portfolio investors) together owned 40.7 percent of Indian equities, which is the highest level in history, said Morgan Stanley&rsquo;s Sheela Rathi and Ridham Desai in a note. Sequentially, this is the sharpest increase since March 2012. While mutual funds have been on a buying spree of late, foreign portfolio investors too are not far behind. In the June quarter, FPI equity ownership rose to 27.5 percent, even higher than the September 2016 high of 27.3 percent. Domestic mutual funds now own 5.6 percent of Indian equities.\n",

            "Malini BhuptaMoneycontrol NewsBattle lines are drawn yet again between large incumbent telecom operators and disruptive recent entrant Jio (owned by Reliance Industries). This time the dispute is over interconnect usage charge (IUC) or mobile interconnect charge (MTC), a charge that is paid by the service provider whose subscriber makes the call to the service provider in whose network the call is received. So if a caller of Idea calls a subscriber of Airtel, Idea pays Airtel 14 paise/min. Idea recovers this amount from its subscriber; the receiving party doesn&rsquo;t pay anything in India.IUC is important not only from the perspective of operators as it gives them a revenue stream, but it is also a key component of voice tariffs and, therefore, also has a bearing on consumers&rsquo; monthly bills. This underscores the importance of the battle between the incumbent telecom operators and Jio.In order to understand why smaller operators are asking for lower IUC while incumbents are asking for a higher charge, it is important to understand how the termination charge can be used as a lever by operators to change the competitive dynamics.For instance, if mobile termination rates are too high then smaller operators &ndash; a group that currently includes Jio -- will never be able to attract new customers as costs would be high. A Trai consultation paper to review interconnect charge in 2014 highlighted this point and said: &ldquo;A large network may also seek to foreclose entry by charging high interconnection prices, which eliminates or weakens smaller competitors for the same pool of retail customers. In addition, a large network will, other things being equal, benefit from high interconnection charges which enhance its revenues.&rdquo; Smaller operators point out that globally IUC has been consistently coming down as a percentage of voice tariffs.In fact, the share of IUC in overall voice tariff is between 1-13 percent in other global markets. In India, IUC accounts for 45 percent of voice tariff assuming voice tariffs are at 31 paise per minute. That said, it&rsquo;s worth noting that in absolute terms India&rsquo;s voice tariffs and interconnect charges are the lowest in the world and the share of IUC has been rising because tariffs have been driven down by competition.Interconnect charges have never been an easy subject for India&rsquo;s regulators and all decisions to lower them have been challenged by the incumbents in courts. Interconnect usage charge was last reviewed and lowered to 14 paise/min from 20 paise/min in 2015, when Rahul Khullar was the Trai Chairman.The regulator has now decided to review the termination charge again to evaluate if Bill and Keep (BAK, a regime where each operator bills its customers and keeps the money) can be implemented. Most regulators across the world have moved to a regime of low interconnect charges or BAK; BAK works best where there is symmetry in traffic or there are two operators, like in the United States.The technological reason for IUC to fall is a change in how voice traffic is carried on mobile networks. As telcos migrate to the next generation IP (internet protocol) networks, the cost of carrying voice traffic is zero as carrying voice in the form of data packets requires little bandwidth.The IP network carries voice on LTE (VoLTE) or voice over internet protocol (VoIP). In 2014 when the telecom regulator had discussed the migration from GSM (Global System for Mobile Communication) to VoLTE, the assessment was that the time was not right and operators needed time. Now with Jio having launched its voice services on VoLTE and other operators looking to launch later this year, the argument to lower termination charges sounds logical.Voice and SMS business for telecom operators across the world have been on the wane for years thanks to over-the-top (OTT) apps like WhatsApp and Skype. Between 2012 and 2018, global telcos&nbsp;are expected to lose USD 386 billion in revenues, says Fortune magazine. In several world markets voice is already free; this has been enabled by telcos moving to VoIP or VoLTE. The same would have played out in India, Jio or no Jio, if data and handset prices had been allowed to fall.At Rs 250/GB of data and expensive handsets, data penetration did not pick up until Jio shook things up. There is plenty of demand for data in India: currently the country uses 120 crore GB a month, up eight times from last year&rsquo;s figure. A higher IUC on voice would skew Jio&rsquo;s economics and affect its financials.Jio has launched its services on an IP network and voice services are offered through LTE or VoLTE. However, when the call terminates on GSM networks, subscribers of those other networks can receive the call even if they don't have VoLTE handsets. Incumbent telecom operators want interconnect charges be doubled from the current 14 paise/minute as the asymmetry in voice traffic has increased substantially after the launch of Reliance Jio&rsquo;s services and announced free voice services. With the increase in traffic, the incumbents are claiming that they need to make additional investments to support a &lsquo;tsunami of traffic&rsquo;.However, this argument of incumbents telecom, experts say, is hard to comprehend because they are asking for higher charges to support legacy technology. An industry veteran asks: &amp;quot;Why should consumers pay for an inefficient, legacy technology?&amp;quot; If the interconnect charges are high then Jio would not be able to price its services attractively and take data to remote parts of the country even if its own cost of voice is significantly lower than those of the incumbents. Jio is seeking to change the industry&rsquo;s dynamics by offering voice free and push data usage. If Jio has to offer services at attractive rates, then it needs to also bring down costs and IUC is a big component of its cost structure. It is for this reason the Jio is arguing for either a very low mobile termination charge or BAK.Industry experts believe that incumbents will find it very hard to justify higher interconnect charges only so that operators can support legacy 2G networks. Former regulators and telecom experts agree that incumbents demand higher IUC when networks are moving to IP and voice will be delivered on VoLTE is rather strange.A very senior retired government official, who was closely associated with the sector, says Jio&rsquo;s argument for zero IUC is valid if networks are moving to VoLTE as the cost of carrying voice is negligible or zero on such IP networks. Airtel, Vodafone and Idea have talked themselves into a tough spot by announcing a shift to VoLTE and asking for higher charges to support an outdated technology.At a simplistic level, voice delivered through IP is very different from 2G. According to some estimates, voice requires 18 kbps throughput which is equal to less than 0.13 MB per minute data equivalent. With data prices falling to Rs 10/GB this translates into 0.13 paise per minute. An IUC of 14 paise per minute would amount to substantially high per GB rate. The incumbents are also asking for a floor price for voice; this militates against the broader national aim of getting the best prices for consumers.Industry stalwarts claim that incumbents want to restrict Jio by ratcheting up interconnect charges because Jio is well placed to offer voice and data services across India, as it has spectrum in the sub-1 Ghz band (850 Mhz), while incumbents don&rsquo;t have it in the sub-1 Ghz band yet. For VoLTE sub-1 Ghz spectrum is critical. This means that if Airtel, Vodafone or Idea have to launch VoLTE it would be on 1800 Mhz or 2300 Mhz, which are not very efficient for launch of voice over LTE. So while incumbents would be able to offer voice on GSM technology in rural areas, delivering data would take them longer. Jio, on the other, hand can offer voice and data in the remotest part of the country as it has built a network that is capable of delivering that.Experts argue that while the regulator may find it hard to justify BAK, mobile termination charge can only go down from here as the shift in technology has driven down costs for voice, too. Globally, the move is towards unlimited voice and data: Telcos are moving to speed-based pricing instead of per GB and per minute rates.(Disclosure : Reliance Industries Ltd. is the sole beneficiary of Independent Media Trust which controls Network18 Media &amp;amp;amp; Investments Ltd.)\n",

            "Moneycontrol NewsIn the recently concluded meeting between the Finance Ministry and Telecommunications Department, inter-ministerial group (IMG) is said to have discussed relaxing spectrum payments for telcos. The deferred payment period for spectrum is likely to be extended to 16 years (earlier 10 years), reveal sources to Financial Express. There could also be some relief on the interest front as telcos will likely to levied an MCLR of 8 percent as against the current prime lending rate of 12 percent, reports the newspapers.These relief measures, if they come about, are expected to ease cash flow pressures for the telecommunications sector. The current norm is that if telecos have paid between 25 and 50 percent of the bid amount (as per their spectrum band), they will get a two-year moratorium.&nbsp;After the two-year period, the operators will have to pay the balance in 10 instalments within a decade.At the IMG, Bharti Airtel urged for extending the moratorium to five years and increasing the number of instalments to 15.&nbsp;Idea Cellular asked for the number of instalments to be increased to 20.The other demands which were pitched in by the operators are said to have been rejected. All the&nbsp;telcos&nbsp;asked for a reduction in licence fee, spectrum usage charge (SUC) and reducing the 18 percent GST rate.The telecos opted for the licence fee to be cut to around 1 percent of their adjusted gross revenue against the current 8 percent. On SUC, they wanted it to fall by 2 percent, making it 1 percent.Mobile termination rates will be as per TRAI's (Telecom Regulatory Authority of India) decision. TRAI is currently reviewing the 14 paise per minute charges. Bharti Airtel and others want this to be hiked to 30-35 paise per minute whereas Jio (owned by Reliance Industries) is opting for a bill and keep (Net Payment Zero).The telecoms have a Rs 4.60 lakh crore debt.(Disclosure : Reliance Industries Ltd. is the sole beneficiary of Independent Media Trust which controls Network18 Media &amp;amp;amp; Investments Ltd.)&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;\n",

We could bring the first set of vehicles in 2018 into the country,&amp;quot; Mercedes-Benz India Managing Director and CEO Roland Folger told PTI when asked about the company's plans regarding launch of vehicles compliant with Bharat Stage (BS) VI emission norms. The move would, however, depend on issues like availability of BS VI grade fuel by 2018, he added.&amp;quot;We are already talking to some of the oil and gas companies or it is going to be something which nobody expects us to do,&amp;quot; Folger said. When asked if the company would work with some of the oil and gas companies to source BSVI grade fuel, Folger said: &amp;quot;Of course, we work with some of them.&amp;quot; Citing the example of Reliance Industries, he added that the oil and gas major has been exporting BS VI oil for the last five years.&amp;quot;They are exporting to Europe, US. They actually produce more BS VI grade fuel for export markets than they do normal fuels for India,&amp;quot; Folger said. He added that the major challenge in front of them is the availability of BS VI fuel across adequate fuel stations across the country.&amp;quot;If say 50 of our vehicles come into the marketplace how many fuel stations you expect to get BS VI fuel and how much time will it take to ramp it up. It is a hen and egg situation. We are waiting for all the fuel to be available and the fuel stations are waiting for all the vehicles to be there,&amp;quot; Folger said.He added that it was important to start as early as possible with smaller volumes and then ramp it up accordingly. Elaborating further he said the company is in talks with various ministries regarding the issue.&amp;quot;We have already asked Ministry of Road Transport and Highways whether they would support us and they haven't said no. They have asked us to speak to oil and gas companies and that's what we are doing,&amp;quot; Folger said.In a bid to curb vehicular pollution, the government has decided to implement stricter emission norms of BS VI from April 1, 2020 by skipping BS-V altogether.

            "Moneycontrol NewsReliance Industries was buzzing in trade on Monday, following its Q1 results as well as developments around the annual general meeting (AGM) held last week.The Mukesh Ambani-promoted company, at the AGM, unveiled a feature phone that will be available for its users for effectively free of cost. A refundable security deposit of Rs 1,500 will have to be paid while availing the handset, which will be returned after 36 months.The company&rsquo;s earnings surpassed analysts' expectations on Thursday as consolidated profit grew by 12.7 percent sequentially (up 28.3 percent YoY) to Rs 9,079 crore in Q1 FY18, driven by one-time gain and robust growth in petchem &amp;amp;amp; refining businesses.Revenue from operations during the quarter declined 2.5 percent to Rs 90,537 crore QoQ but increased 26.7 percent year-on-year.&amp;quot;Industry leading portfolio of assets in the refining and petrochemicals business contributed to considerable improvement in earnings for the quarter,&amp;quot; Mukesh Dhirubhai Ambani, Chairman and Managing Director said.Gross refining margin for the quarter grew by 3.5 percent to 9-year high of USD 11.9 a barrel against USD 11.50 a barrel on a sequential basis.Singapore GRM was flat at USD 6.40 a barrel QoQ as lower cracks for light and middle distillates were offset by stronger fuel oil cracks and lower freight, it said.Major global brokerages have retained their positive stance on the stock, while highlighting a pickup in monetisation plans, along with EPS upgrades due to the introduction of the phone.Brokerage: Citi | Rating: Buy | Target: Rs 1,750Citi observed that the upfront deposit for JioPhone is higher than the average feature phone price. It forecast an EBITDA CAGR of 14 percent ex-Jio and 25 percent including Jio over FY17-20.Brokerage: Morgan Stanley | Rating: Overweight | Target: Increased to Rs 1,823The brokerage highlighted that the company&rsquo;s monetisation plans were picking up pace, while energy margins were driving upside surprises. The capex run rate has slowed and free cash flow drag have almost halved in Q1. It projects positive FCF by mid-2018 by mid-2018.Brokerage: Bank of America Merrill Lynch | Rating: Neutral | Target: Rs 1,585The global brokerage firm said that much of the value for Jio is now discounted in the stock. Further, the telecom profitability may take some time, it added.Brokerage: CLSA | Rating: Buy | Target: Rs 1,920The brokerage said that feature phones drive 1-24% EPS upgrades. It has raised Jio&rsquo;s EBITDA by well over USD 1 billion for FY18-20. The strong demand for 4G feature phones and start of key projects are potential catalysts.Brokerage: JPMorgan | Rating: Neutral | Target: Rs 1,460The global research firm raised EPS estimates by 4-8 percent, driven by higher gross refining margins and petchem spreads. The key downside risks include continued extension of discounting schemes.Brokerage: Kotak Institutional Equities | Rating: Downgrade to Reduce |: Target: Rs 1,500Remain wary of high capex run-rate &amp;amp;amp; rising net debt levels and added that debt may take time to reduce.Disclosure: Reliance Industries Ltd. is the sole beneficiary of Independent Media Trust which controls Network18 Media &amp;amp;amp; Investments Ltd.\n",

Gross refining margin for the quarter grew by 3.5 percent to a 9-year high of USD 11.9 a barrel against USD 11.50 a barrel on a sequential basis.The Q1 results pushed RIL to fresh 9-year high. The company has performed on all growth and profitability parameters across petrochemical, telecom, and retail divisions.But, the trend might be slowly switching towards telecom and retail which will lead the next leg of growth for Reliance Industries as indicated by Mukesh Ambani, Chairman, RIL in 40th AGM.The key highlight of RIL&rsquo;s 40th AGM was the aggressive expansion of Jio through a) launch of Volte phone free of cost, and b) market leading rates for data/television services on JIO and, c) the fast-growing technological additions to JIO.&ldquo;The company is changing gear on telecom and retail business with growth across top line and bottom line and we believe that the next set of positive surprises on profit numbers will be visible from these two divisions over next 12 months,&rdquo; Nikhil Khandelwal, MD, Systematix Shares told Moneycontrol.&amp;quot;Investors should continue to maintain longs or enter into new long positions in Reliance. We have a target of Rs 1,800 on the stock from 12 months perspective,&amp;quot;&nbsp;he said.Meanwhile, Abhijeet Bora, Research Analyst, Oil &amp;amp;amp; Gas, Sharekhan advises investors to stay invested in Reliance Industries for the long term to benefit from earnings growth from commissioning of downstream projects and likely value creation from telecom venture.&ldquo;We have a price target of Rs 1,665 on Reliance Industries,&amp;quot;&nbsp;he said.Bonus issue good for investor sentimentReliance Industries in its 40th Annual General Meeting (AGM) in Mumbai, announced a bonus issue of 1:1. This means that shareholders will get 1 bonus share for every one share held by an investor.Well, this is the largest bonus issue in the country. Historically speaking, the company had previously announced a bonus issue prior to this in the years of 2009, 1997 and 1983.&amp;quot;The predatory strategy to capture telecom space is quite aggressive and highly disruptive. The bargaining power that the company will enjoy once the competition is marginalized would be immense which is good for the investors in their long-term wealth creation journey,&amp;quot; Jimeet Modi, CEO, SAMCO Securities told Moneycontrol.&amp;quot;It is a great opportunity for Reliance investors to enjoy the telecom wave plus the added 1:1 bonus advantage in the short term. One man&rsquo;s gain is other&rsquo;s loss is the reality in the telecom space,&amp;quot; he said.Technical OutlookThe counter has rallied more than 5 percent in the last two weeks and the patterns on the weekly charts are looking indecisive. Added to this, last few days of price behaviour suggests that RIL could see some consolidation or mild correction.&ldquo;As this energy giant has completely underperformed for a considerable period of time and a late entrant in this bull market with a massive breakout above its 8-year-old triangular formation, long term trends are very attractively placed,&rdquo; Mazhar Mohammad, Chief Strategist &ndash; Technical Research &amp;amp;amp; Trading Advisory, Chartviewindia.in told Moneycontrol.&ldquo;Hence, any decent correction should be considered only as a buying opportunity. If this counter is available in the zone of Rs 1,460&ndash;Rs 1,427 one should pick it up for a one year target of Rs1,649,&rdquo; he said.(Disclosure : Reliance Industries Ltd. is the sole beneficiary of Independent Media Trust which controls Network18 Media &amp;amp;amp; Investments Ltd.)\n",

            "Nitin AgrawalMoneycontrol ResearchReliance Industries&rsquo; AGM had surprises besides the 1:1 bonus share issue, which incidentally was reduced to a sideshow. The bigger talking points were the launch of JioPhone (with features of a 4G phone) and the aggressive tariff plans. Rival telecom operators who were bracing for more hurt can perhaps take solace in the fact they will not be the only ones suffering. Reliance&rsquo;s ambitious plans threaten the earnings of DTH and broadband players as well as cable operators. We do not fundamentally see this as a drain on earnings of Reliance Industries although we await some more clarity to deliver a final verdict on the same.The Plans in a SnapshotCustomers looking to buy JioPhone will have to pay Rs 1,500 up front, which will be refundable after three years, thereby making the effective price of the handset zero.Jio will work on increasing its coverage and has set a target of covering 99 percent of the population, much higher than the conventional 2G coverage.The company also plans to open up 10,000 sales partners and increase touch points in Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities.Voice will be free for life-time on JioPhone; however, customers will have to pay Rs 153 per month to access data (0.5 GB per day) services and various other entertainment content.JioPhone TV cable will let customers connect Jio Phone to any TV. Customers can opt for existing Jio Dhan Dhan Dhan of Rs 309 pack that would allow users to watch almost 3-4 hours of videos daily, of their choice, on a large screen.Additionally, Jio also launched 2 days and 7 days sachets at Rs 23 and Rs 53, respectively, to attract customers who cannot pay Rs 153 in a go.What it means for the incumbent telcos?With the above mentioned plans, Jio is now entering a market of 2G customers who were not exposed to the world of data due to the limitation of not owning an expensive hand-held device. Mukesh Ambani believes that there are close to 50 crore Indians who do not have access to 4G smart phone mainly because of its affordability and wanted to launch a 4G feature phone to cater to that section of the society.By offering the phone technically free, the company is ensuring itself of an ARPU (average revenue per user) of Rs 153, and this sets the ceiling for ARPU of incumbent operators who are looking beyond the urban market for growth.Interestingly, the voice ARPU of this segment of users is reportedly in double digits. If Jio is able to migrate a sizeable population to its Jio Phone, the ARPU improvement for the company will be significant. While we do not expect the entire population to migrate, 10-15 percent migration in the next couple of years wouldn&rsquo;t be a tall target.While the impact on the incumbent telcos is known, the bigger surprise was the attack on the cable operators, DTH players and broadband operators with JioPhone TV cable. The Dhan Dhana Dan offer at Rs 309 works out to an ARPU of Rs 165, which is close to what most of the DTH operators were making in a stable macro environment.&amp;amp;nbsp;However, pricing cannot be the only reason to shift from existing service providers. We feel that the acquisition of close to 25 percent stake in Balaji Telefilms will have far reaching implications for the business. Jio is likely to use Balaji and churn out exclusive content for its subscribers (akin to what players like Netflix does in the west) to wean away customers from competition.Read more:&nbsp;Free voice not enough, Ambani wants free phone to Jio democratic digital cultureWhat it means for Jio?What is comforting for us is RIL&rsquo;s focus on monetizing even from the so-called &ldquo;bottom of the pyramid&rdquo; while making the offer look like a freebie. Our back-of-the-envelope calculation suggests that Reliance is likely to generate revenue of close to Rs 20,336 crore in FY18 and Rs 32, 370 crore in FY19 which is close to 4.5 percent of its FY18 revenue and 6.7 percent of its FY19 revenue.In a move that makes sense both from a business and financial perspective, the Rs 1500 payment upfront for acquiring the phone would be positive from a working capital perspective. Finally, should the cost of acquisition of the phone get depreciated over three years, it would create a tax shield to minimize the financial cost of this plan.So, while the earnings impact of today&rsquo;s agenda may not be significant for Reliance&rsquo;s bottomline in the coming two years (that will basically ride on an improved core earnings), it marks a change in more ways than one. Firstly, it weakens the competition, makes data usage a part of life for more Indians that can be successfully capitalized at a later stage when competition thins out to a great extent.(Disclosure : Reliance Industries Ltd. is the sole beneficiary of Independent Media Trust which controls Network18 Media &amp;amp;amp; Investments Ltd.): Follow @agrawant\n",

            "Just as RIL heralded the equity culture in India, it now aims to, in Reliance Industries Chairman Mukesh Ambani&rsquo;s own words, &ldquo;democratise the digital culture in India&rdquo;\n",
            "Dhirendra Tripathi Moneycontrol NewsWhat would one expect at the 40th Annual General Meeting of a company that is synonymous with size? Expect more of it? Yes. Because just as the company heralded the equity culture in India, it now aims to, in Reliance Industries Chairman Mukesh Ambani&rsquo;s own words, &ldquo;democratise the digital culture in India&rdquo;. So a 1:1 bonus, the largest in India&rsquo;s corporate history, was lost in the din. What took over the mindspace at Birla Matushree was a free, intelligent and feature-rich JioPhone.Subscribers will be able to enjoy unlimited data on the JioPhone at Rs 153 every month. They will also have the option of recharging with a Rs 53 voucher that will run for a week or with a Rs 23 coupon carrying a two-day validity.The impact of today&rsquo;s announcement will be felt far and wide. While RIL subsidiary Reliance Jio Infocomm continues to rattle the incumbent mobile service providers, today&rsquo;s announcements shook up shares of cable TV distributors and direct-to-home TV service providers as well. Surely, the disruption unleashed by Reliance Jio last year is set to spread to other industries.Telecom &amp;amp;amp; DTH Stocks CrackRIL share rose 3% while those of incumbent mobile operators like Bharti Airtel and Idea Cellular were down 3% and 5%, respectively. Direct-to-home service providers like Dish TV and Sun TV too fell 7% and 4%, respectively. Ambani reiterating his company&rsquo;s commitment to bringing world-class, super-fast optic fiber broadband connectivity to people&rsquo;s homes only made the matters worse for those stocks.The Jio Phone will initially cost Rs 1,500 but this will be refundable after three years. The most unique feature about the phone is that the user will be able to connect the mobile to any kind of TV including the old, bulky TVs known as CRT (cathode ray tube) TVs and mirror all content. &nbsp;Like the 125 million Jio service users so far, all Jio Phone buyers will also get free voice calls.JioPhone AvailabilityAvailable for beta testing from August 15, the bookings for the JioPhone will start from August 24. Buyers who have pre booked will get the phones from September on &lsquo;first come, first served&rsquo; basis. All JioPhones will be made in India from October.The spirit of Ambani&rsquo;s almost one-hour-long speech went with the faith of the company&rsquo;s 2.5 million plus shareholders, the chants of &ldquo;Jio, Jio&rdquo; inside the auditorium complimenting the passionate speech.Higher StakesWhile in Ambani&rsquo;s words, Reliance&rsquo;s Golden Decade has just begun, it is not the first time India&rsquo;s most valuable company has disrupted the market. People still remember the sturdy, blue screen and white body LG and Samsung phones that allowed them to &lsquo;Kar Lo Duniya Mutthi Mein&rsquo;. The &lsquo;Monsoon&rsquo; had a lot of &lsquo;Hungama&rsquo; then too and the CDMA voice those days was as clear as they came.The stakes are only higher and wider this time. The pre-2000 India was a country coming out of licence raj and landlines still ruled. A 3-minute inter-state call &mdash; known as STD or trunk call &mdash; cost as much as Rs. 24 even in early 2000. Today&rsquo;s India is vastly different, as Jio has itself demonstrated &mdash; the company garnered 100 million customers within 170 days of its launch. It added 7 customers per second every single day &mdash; faster than Facebook, WhatsApp or Skype. It is the largest and the fastest technology adoption of any kind anywhere in the world.RIL, with Jio, is not going to be content just connecting people through voice and data. It wants to get inside homes, influence &mdash; if not rule &mdash; daily lives. Offering a phone that&rsquo;s virtually free, can take voice commands and also carry content to any TV marks a paradigm shift that may wipe out existing industries and create new ones.With an eye on replacing the 50 crore feature phone users in India, a target of making 5 million JioPhones available every week conveys a very small message of the big story.Disclosure: Reliance Industries Ltd. is the sole beneficiary of Independent Media Trust which controls Network18 Media &amp;amp;amp; Investments Ltd.\n",

            "Moneycontrol NewsIn a move that can sound the death knell for 2G phones and 2G services, Reliance Industries Limited&nbsp;on Friday launched JioPhone &amp;quot;effectively&amp;quot; free of cost. The 4G feature phone comes with some amazing features but the most striking one could be its ability to connect to just about any television with the help of just a cable.JioPhone lets users watch their favourite TV content, Live TV, movies, educational programs and can simultaneously mirror their phone on to their TV screen. Not just a LED TV, but JioPhone can also connect to an ordinary CRT TV.Here are some of the other physical features of the phone:-&mdash; Ability to be operated on voice command&mdash; An Alpha numeric keypad&mdash; 2.4 inch QVGA display&mdash; FM Radio and Torchlight&mdash; An SD Card slot&mdash; A four way navigation system&mdash; Apart from these the phone will come pre-loaded with Jio Apps such as JioMusic, JioCinema and JioTV.To top it all, the company has also announced plans to incorporate NFC technology into the phone later this year. NFC or Near Field Communication allows exchange of files, pictures and videos between two phones. The technology can also be used to make payments, doing away with the need to have debit/credit cards in person. Simply, store card/account details on the phone and&nbsp;tap on NFC-enabled devices to make payments at grocery stores, retail shops and other outlets.RIL has announced three plans for the JioPhone which includes a weekly plan of Rs 53, a two day plan of Rs 23 along with the Rs 153 plan which will offer unlimited data, unlimited talk time and unlimited SMS.The JioPhone will be launched on August 15 and will be available for pre-booking from August 24.\n",

            "In an interview to CNBC-TV18, SP Tulsian of sptulsian.com shared his readings and outlook on the market and specific stocks and sectors.\n",
            "In an interview to CNBC-TV18, SP Tulsian of sptulsian.com shared his readings and outlook on the market and specific stocks and sectors.Below is the verbatim transcript of the interview.Reema: Can you first run us through your recommendation for today, Singer India.A: This is a debt free multinational company and Singer of Netherlands, they are holding 72 percent stake in the company. If you see the main business of the company, is that of sewing machine marketed under the brand name of Singer Merritt. We all know that those who have been growing in this country that Singer is a name to reckon with. This is a 150 year old brand.Apart from that, company from last one year has moved into household appliances also and because of the excellent pan India distribution network, they thought that probably moving into household appliances will be a logical expansion by the consumer durable company and this is seen panning out. Now it is indicated that the company is seen going very aggressive in the time to come to expand the household portfolio because till FY17, the financial performance has not been that great on the household appliances front. Only the sewing machines have been contributing to the entire turnover and profitability of the company.Go on the financials, Rs 375 crore turnover, operating profit 10 percent, 35 percent increase on operating profit, 55 percent increase on topline, and PAT has risen to Rs 8 crore plus; again 35 percent increase, EPS of Rs 7.50. As I said, it is a debt free company, company has the plans of moving into the domestic appliances and kitchen appliances, I am expecting that the kind of valuations now given the consumer appliances company, you get to read the news at Ken Star just getting an offer of about Rs 1,200 crore for buying the brands and all that.I am not saying that the company is owning Singer brand, because brand is owned by their parents Netherland, but the kind of ramp up which we are going to see and diversification into the consumer appliances with MNC status, probably maybe it is not in FY18-FY19 the company will move into double digit EPS and taking that into consideration, probably at a P/E multiple of 25-26 on a forward earnings, not on the current year&rsquo;s earnings, share looks very cheap.In fact on the same basis, I have recommended Multibase if you recall about a month back which has almost moved up by about 40 percent in this last maybe 1-1.5 month. So, this is also another MNC looking very good with a target of Rs 360 expected in next six months or so.Latha: I just wanted your thoughts on Reliance Industries?A: Yesterday I have expressed my view that excellent numbers and if you see the core business showing this kind of tremendous increase of about 150 basis points or maybe 10 percent increase in petchem and 15 percent, that is phenomenal and that is bound to see getting reflected into the share price by P/E expansion because people have all been talking of Reliance Jio, but if you see their core business and if they keep reporting an EBIT margin of 10 percent plus, because refining segments never had an EBIT margin of more than 8-9 percent or in a range of 8-9.Company has now moved into the range of maybe anywhere between 10 and 11.5. Similar is the case with petchem; never moved beyond 12-14 percent but now seem to be in the 14-16 percent range. These are things are likely to sustain because when the crude has fallen, when you did not have any kind of inventory loss or maybe when the GRMs have been soft and in that scenario if the company is able to post GRM of 11.6 percent, I think it is phenomenal.So, taking all this into consideration, if I take a P/E of, maybe blended P/E of 16, if I apply different P/E multiple, maybe on refining about 10-11 P/E multiple, on petchem about 20-21 because if you see the P/E multiple given to Finolex Industry kind of things, maybe on Reliance Jio, on the net present or net asset value, finance and all that, maybe a P/E multiple of 12-14 you can easily give a blended P/E multiple of about 16-17 and that translates into a share price of 1,780-1,880 maybe in next 6-12 months.In fact yesterday I have expressed my view that probably this time post numbers we will see Reliance Industries trading in the green with an uptick of maybe closer to 4 percent or so.Reema: What are your thoughts on Jaiprakash Associates, I think you have been positive on Jaypee Infratech, but how would you approach some of the other stocks?A: If you see why Rakesh Jhunjhunwala has bought, he has seen the potential of the assets and the future earnings potential after the debt restructuring. In fact, I have propagated this theory when many of the experts and channels were not agreeing with that view that equity has zero value, they are all junk, ultimately will get liquidated kind of things. So similar pattern and at that time I have been very categorical in saying that take your call on these stocks.If you recall, at that time JP Associates was at Rs 13-14, Jaypee Infratech was at Rs 9, Bhushan Steel was at Rs 50, Monnet Ispat at Rs 30, Amtek Auto at Rs 25 and still I maintained the same view. This has happened in case of JP Associates but that kind of dramatic upturn you are going to see in cases of other stocks also which I have said. So, I am keeping a very hopeful and positive bias because if a stock specific case, I will say that JP Associates has gone leaner with a debt of about Rs 10,000 crore now with a real estate, hotel property, EPC business, cement capacity of 6-8 million tonne and these type of call needs to be taken for each company.In fact about a month back on the channel I have said that these kind of stocks can give you a return of 100-200 percent. I still maintain my same view for these four to five stocks which I have said and I won&rsquo;t be finding much risk in JP Associates even at the current levels or maybe in Jaypee Infratech if an investor has a view of about one year. You are right in cautioning that Rakesh has a cost of about Rs 13-14 and probably JP Associates maybe in the F&amp;amp;amp;O ban also, so don&rsquo;t take trading call, be an investor. If you take a daily swing with the price volatility, these stocks are not meant for those kind of investors, but I see huge potential even in JP Associates from here on going forward.\n",

Despite flat Singapore Complex Margin, Reliance&rsquo;s GRM outperformed Singapore complex margins by $ 5.5/bbl. The marginally weaker product cracks were offset by yield shift and robust feedstock management. Favourable Brent-Dubai differential also aided crude sourcing during the quarter.Highest petchem marginFor the petrochemicals segment, revenue increase of 22.9% was aided by price increase and volume expansion due to capacity addition. The EBIT margin for the quarter was at 15.8%, at an all-time high level.During the quarter the company has commissioned the PX facility which should support the earnings momentum going forward as well. With the commissioning of this plant, RIL&rsquo;s PX capacity has more than doubled making it world&rsquo;s second largest producer of PX with about 11% of global production.Retail &ndash; strong showRetail also reported a strong show with revenue registering a growth of 74%. Margins improved a tad and the business added 18 stores during the quarter thereby taking the total number of stores to 3,634.Oil &amp;amp;amp; Gas &ndash; the new beginning?However, Oil &amp;amp;amp; Gas continued with a subdued show &ndash; revenues de-growing by 1.2% led by lower volumes in US shale and domestic operations. However, it is important to note that the financial performance of US Shale has improved driven by better price environment, slightly higher production and stable cost structure.For the Indian upstream business, in June 2017, Reliance and BP have announced their intent to develop already discovered deep water gas fields.Time to reap benefits of long gestation capexRIL&rsquo;s USD 18.5&nbsp;billion core projects (petcoke gasification, polyester expansion, off-gas cracker and ethane sourcing) are now either complete or on the verge of completion. The massive capex had supressed return ratios so far. Since many of the long gestation projects for RIL are nearing commissioning, this should significantly improve return ratios and cash flows going forward.In FY17, RIL completed the world&rsquo;s largest and most complex ethane sourcing project. The PX facility has been commissioned in the quarter. The Refinery Off gas Cracker (ROGC) project is expected to be fully commissioned by 3QFY18, and the petcoke gasifier project by 4QFY18.The AGM will perhaps throw more light on the timeline of these project commissioning. Market also awaits clarity on Jio&rsquo;s capex in light of the surprise fund raising that got announced.What next for Jio?Reliance surprised the street by announcing Rs20,000 crore rights issue of optionally convertible preference shares for Jio to further fund its 4G foray. The money raised through rights issue would be utilized to further strengthen Jio&rsquo;s network reach and quality.After intensifying the price war in the industry by providing freebies, Jio is now moving towards monetizing its customer base, which stands at 117.4 million at the end of May-2017 (up from 108.9 million in Mar 2017) and following a balanced approach between revenue growth and subscribers addition.The company has recently come up with new plans wherein it has reduced the validity indicating an uptick in ARPU (average revenue per user). The most prominent plan of Rs399 for 84 days validity translates into an ARPU of close to Rs124, up from Rs94 based on the earlier plan (Rs309 for 84 days). This, however, is much lower than the incumbents&rsquo; ARPU (Airtel: Rs 158, Vodafone: Rs 142, Idea: Rs 142).Based on ARPU and subscribers base, our back-of-the-envelope calculations suggest that Jio is expected to generate Rs12,450 crores of revenues in FY2018. Moreover, we believe that the potential consolidation in the industry will support the case for higher ARPU for the key players in the industry.Additionally, Jio&rsquo;s plan to launch Rs500 4G mobile phone would give it an edge in capturing additional subscribers coming from the mass market and can help it penetrate in rural areas.The new addition &ndash; Balaji TeleWhat took he street by surprise was Reliance&rsquo;s investment of Rs413 crore (24.9 percent stake) in Balaji Telefilms. This investment will act as a medium to source content for its Jio platform. Experts believe this to be a very rational and relevant move.In sum, with capex in core projects now translating to cash flows and telecom staring at break-even, despite the run up in the stock, the valuation at 12.5X projected earnings of FY18 deserves attention.(Disclosure : Reliance Industries Ltd. is the sole beneficiary of Independent Media Trust which controls Network18 Media &amp;amp;amp; Investments Ltd.)\n",

            "Kshitij AnandMoneycontrol NewsReliance Industries delivered a massive beat in almost all parameters when it reported its results for the quarter ended June on Thursday. The stock could well open with a gap up of 3-5 percent on Friday, suggest experts.&ldquo;RIL reported a massive beat when compared with estimates and given the fact that it has already rallied quite a lot so far in the year 2017, I expect the stock to open higher with a 3-5 percent gap on Friday,&rdquo; SP Tulsian of sptulsian.com said in an interview to CNBC-TV18.Meanwhile, Prakash Diwan of Altamount Capital Management said that the stock is likely to form a solid base at Rs 1,500-1,525 levels and the only way the stock is heading is up.It could rally 3-5-10 percent in few weeks as well, but the idea is that RIL is heading higher and there is no case of major downside, he said.We have collated a list of top 10 takeaways from RIL Q1 results:Net Profit up 28%RIL reported 28 percent YoY growth in net profit to Rs9,108 crore which was higher than a CNBC-TV18 poll of 7,960 crores. The oil &amp;amp;amp; gas major reported a net profit of Rs7,113 crore in the corresponding quarter of last fiscal.&ldquo;Our Company recorded yet another strong quarterly performance with a net profit of Rs9,108 crores, up 28% Y-o-Y. Our industry leading portfolio of assets in the refining and petrochemicals business contributed to the considerable improvement in our earnings for the quarter,&rdquo; Mukesh D. Ambani, Chairman, and Managing Director, Reliance Industries Limited said in the press release.Total Revenues:Consolidated Total revenues rose 27.7 percent on a YoY basis to Rs90,537 crore for the quarter ended June 30, compared to Rs71,451 crore reported in the year-ago period.The increase in revenue is primarily on account of increase in prices and volumes of refining and petrochemical products partially offset by lower prices and volumes from E&amp;amp;amp;P business.Revenue was also boosted by robust growth in retail business which recorded a 73.6% increase in revenue to a Rs11,571 crore. Brent crude oil price averaged $ 49.9/bbl in 1Q FY18 as compared to $ 45.6/bbl in the corresponding period of the previous year.Strong beat on GRMs:Strong refining and petrochemicals margin environment contributed to higher operating profits for the quarter. Gross refining margins recorded nine-year-high of $ 11.9/bbl whereas petrochemicals EBIT margin were at an all-time high of 15.8 percent.Increase in Employee Cost:Employee cost increased by 16.3 percent at Rs2,455 crore ($ 380 million) as against Rs2,111 crore in corresponding period of the previous year due to increased employee base and higher payouts.Operating profit rose by nearly 12%Operating profit before other income and depreciation increased by 11.9 percent on a Y-o-Y basis to Rs12,554 crore ($ 1.9 billion) from Rs11,223 crore in the previous year.Operating profit was led by robust performance from petrochemicals business and sustained strength in the refining business. This was partially offset by losses in Oil &amp;amp;amp; Gas business due to lower volumes and weak domestic price environment.Capital Expenditure:The capital expenditure for the quarter ended 30th June 2017 was Rs25,192 crore (USD 3.9 billion) including exchange rate difference capitalization.Capital expenditure was principally on account of ongoing projects in the petrochemicals and refining business at Jamnagar and Digital services business.Refining Margins:During 1Q FY18, revenue from the Refining and Marketing segment increased by 18.3 percent on a Y-o-Y basis to Rs66,945 crore (USD 10.4 billion). Gross Refining Margins (GRM) for 1Q FY18 stood at USD 11.9/bbl as against USD 11.5/bbl in 1Q FY17.RIL&rsquo;s GRM outperformed Singapore complex margins by USD 5.5/bbl. Marginally weaker product cracks environment on Q-o-Q basis was offset by yield shift and robust risk management. Further, favorable Brent-Dubai differential aided crude sourcing during the quarter.Petchem Margins: 1Q FY18 revenue from the Petrochemicals segment increased by 22.9 percent on a Y-o-Y basis to Rs25,461 crore (USD 3.9 billion), primarily due to increase in prices of PP, PVC, PTA, and Polyester and increase in volumes due to addition in the capacity of PX at Jamnagar.Petrochemicals segment EBIT increased sharply by 43.7 percent to Rs4,031 crore (USD 624 million), supported by favorable product deltas and volume growth. EBIT margin for the quarter was at 15.8 percent, an all-time high level.Oil &amp;amp;amp; Gas Business:1Q FY18 revenues for the Oil &amp;amp;amp; Gas segment decreased by 1.2 percent on a Y-o-Y basis to Rs 1,324 crore primarily due to lower volumes in US shale and domestic operations. Segment EBIT was at (373) crore, impacted by an overall decline in volumes and lower realizations in domestic business.Retail business revenue grew by 73%1Q FY18 revenues grew by 73.6 percent on a Y-o-Y basis to a Rs11,571 crore, a milestone level for quarterly revenues. The increase in revenue was led by growth across all consumption baskets.The business delivered strong PBDIT of Rs398 crore in 1Q FY18 as against Rs240 crore in the corresponding period of previous year, reflecting a robust growth of 65.8 percent.Disclaimer: Reliance Industries is the sole beneficiary of Independent Media Trust which controls Network18 Media &amp;amp;amp; Investments Ltd.\n",

However, it could not be ascertained if the handsets will be sold by Reliance Retail or Jio.&amp;quot;Reliance has not yet finalised actual unit price of the feature phones, but it is likely to be in the range of Rs 1,000-1,500 a unit. It will be smart feature phone with pre- loaded apps of Reliance Jio like Jio TV, Jio Money etc,&amp;quot; one of the sources who did not wish to be named said.He said the phone will not have touchscreen facility like smartphones, but will have rest of facilities like wi-fi connectivity and browsing and come with a cable that can connect the handset with television sets to watch Jio TV content.&amp;quot;The company is eyeing 2G users who cannot afford expensive smartphones and are paying high call rates. Jio's voice calls will be free which will encourage them to buy these handsets,&amp;quot; the source said.Reliance Jio has started the process of importing handsets and is in discussion with Foxconn and Intex to make them in India.&amp;quot;Around 10 million units are being planned for initial sales and the company has plans to increase inventory to 100 million in the first year and another 100 million next year. Discussions have started with Foxconn and Intex to make these phones in India,&amp;quot; the source said.Mobile industry body Indian Cellular Association in a submission to the government has said the total size of Indian mobile phone market was estimated to be around 280 million units in 2016 and is expected to grow to 320 million by 2018.A source privy to discussions said Intex had approached RIL for bundling Jio service for a state government tender.&amp;quot;Intex will bid for a state government tender which has huge requirement of low-cost mobile phone, but it wants bidder to come with a service provider.

In fact from levels of Rs 1,135 where Reliance gave a big breakout, this stock is in a roaring bull market. Again, Rs 1,475 will be a crucial breakout which it has seen very closely now and stock is definitely headed further upwards. Rs 1,550 can be initial target on Reliance future and have a stop loss of Rs 1,510.&amp;quot;&amp;quot;I have a second buy call on Bharat Financial. This stock should definitely head towards 4-digit very soon. However, now it has given a fresh breakout at levels of Rs 760 and this stock is now headed initially towards levels of Rs 820. The levels of Rs 860 and Rs 925 are also possible and this stock can be bought keeping a stop loss at Rs 760 which has been the recent breakout level.&amp;quot;&amp;quot;I have a last buy call on Ujjivan Financial.

            "IndusInd BankBrokerage: Equirus | Rating: Add | Target: Rs 1,652The brokerage house highlighted that the bank had a stable quarter with results in-line with the estimates. It retained its add call on limited upside. Among key risks, it believes that increase in slippages and slowdown in retail loan demand would be the risks.Brokerage: CLSA | Rating: Buy | Target: Rs 1,870CLSA termed IndusInd Bank&rsquo;s Q1 profit to be a tad ahead of estimates with better net interest income and lower operating expenditure. Having said that, 21 percent quarter on quarter (QoQ) rise in NPLs was a tad disappointing, CLSA mentioned in its report.Going forward, it sees a 25 percent CAGR over FY17-20, while it will watch out for underwriting in unsecured retail loans as well as market risk from higher bond holdings. It also raised the earnings estimates by 1-2 percent.Brokerage: Kotak Equities | Rating: Add | Target: Rs 1,620The brokerage house highlighted that the first quarter was not as stable as previous quarters, but was still going well. Further, it said that valuations are unlikely to change as underlying growth momentum is strong. Further, it expects the bank to deliver 20 percent earnings CAGR over FY17-20 on the back of 25 percent loan growth.Brokerage: Goldman Sachs | Rating: Neutral | Target: Rs 1,499The global research firm called the bank&rsquo;s Q1 to be in line with expectations, but said that the operating trends were not trending. It reduced the FY18-19 earnings per share (EPS) estimates by up to 3 percent on Q1 trends. The neutral stock is given the balanced risk-reward at current valuations.Brokerage: Nomura | Rating: Buy | Target: Rs 1,850Nomura highlighted that improving net interest margins along with lower capital consumption was a key positive. IndusInd Bank delivering profitability with lower capital consumption was also a positive. Meanwhile, it said that the asset quality miss was due to a migration of 50 percent of restructured book into NPAs.Brokerage: Deutsche Bank | Rating: Buy | Target: Rs 1,700The global financial services firm saw strong trends in CASA, while cost ratios improved. Even though the bank reported rise in non-performing loans (NPLs), the overall stress has declined. Further, it said that the balance sheet now is more exposed to interest rate movements than other banks. Meanwhile, slippages increased largely due to restructured loans, it said, adding that it is expecting strong and steady trends for Fy18/19.Brokerage: CIMB | Rating: Add | Target: Rs 1,715CIMB said that the stock is one of the best plays due to retail loan growth. Productivity gains and above-industry growth rates should follow, it added. Further, it sees 26 percent earnings CAGR over FY19-20. Slow growth and rise in delinquencies are key risks, it added.Brokerage: Bank of America Merrill Lynch | Rating: Buy | Target: Rs 1,800The global research firm said that growth and margins sustained and the overall asset quality was comfortable with headline gross NPLs at 109 basis points. The highlight of the quarter was a stronger corporate loan growth at 26 percent year on yearBrokerage: Morgan Stanley | Rating: Overweight | Target: Rs 1,750Morgan Stanley observed that higher provisions and muted vehicle loan growth were softer aspects in the first quarter. Further, it added that it doesn&rsquo;t expect them to be mute going forward. Among key positives are stable margin, strong savings deposit/fee growth as well as higher capital, it added.Brokerage: Jefferies | Rating: Hold | Target: Rs 1,500Jefferies said that utilization of past provisions to improve provision coverage is a positive development. It expects the stock to deliver returns in line with the earnings growth and tweaks estimates by +1.5 percent in FY18 by -2 percent in FY19/20. Sustained loan growth and higher than expected fall in funding cost are the key upside risk, while slower loan growth and asset quality are key downside risks.RelianceBrokerage: CLSA | Rating: BuyCLSA highlighted that Jio&rsquo;s reduction in promotion benefits aims at maximizing subscriber retention. Further, stable &amp;amp;amp; high-speed data performance should make Jio a favoured network.It now awaits clarity if the company will start expensing Jio from the second quarter of this fiscal. It also believes that investors will overlook initial losses during promotional periods and will focus on subscriber retention and slow monetisation.(Disclosure: Reliance Industries Ltd. is the sole beneficiary of Independent Media Trust which controls Network18 Media &amp;amp;amp; Investments Ltd)AutosBrokerage: CLSACLSA expects Eicher Motors, Motherson, and TVS to report best profit growth in Q1. Two-wheeler original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), except Bajaj, could report healthy double digit earnings growth. Meanwhile, it sees Maruti to have a steady quarter. Volume of M&amp;amp;amp;HCVs declined sharply, which should drag the performance of commercial vehicle companies. Further, it sees some impact on margins from higher discounting in June. Maruti EBITDA &amp;amp;amp; profit should grow 11% &amp;amp;amp; 14% yoy respectively, it added.CLSA also expects JLR EBITDA margin to decline to 13%. Further, it said that Tata&rsquo;s India business may remain loss-making. At a consolidated level, Tata Motors&rsquo; EBITDA should decline 8% yoy &amp;amp;amp; profit could fall 41% yoy.\n",

For IDFC, a new structure may take the holding company discount less relevant.BioconBrokerage: Morgan Stanley | Rating: Overweight | Target: Rs 421.33The global research firm said that the company is a beneficiary of unfolding global biosimilar opportunity.

Furthermore, private banks and State Bank of India&rsquo;s (SBI) profit could be stable, but other PSUs may report a sharp fall. It also expects smaller private banks to lead with over 25 percent year on year profit growth.Going forward, asset quality and provisions may drive volatility in profit against the backdrop of large upgrades.

            "In an interview to CNBC-TV18, SP Tulsian of sptulsian.com shared his readings and outlook on the market and specific stocks and sectors.\n",
            "In an interview to CNBC-TV18, SP Tulsian of sptulsian.com shared his readings and outlook on the market and specific stocks and sectors.Below is the verbatim transcript of the interview.Anuj: New 52 week high, in fact new nine year high on Reliance Industries. What are your thoughts on what would have transpired today?A: Difficult to attribute any reason because I can't say that there has been expansion or maybe the value accretion seen in its telecom business. However, one thing which comes to my mind is the expansion in the refining margin because the crude, the kind of corrections which we have seen in crude, one may argue that they will be having the inventory losses, but the kind of end product or maybe the product mix, whether you take gasoline or maybe the middle heavy distillates that is diesel and petrol both, and the kind of procurement which the company is making from the small oil producing countries because the more crude falls, more the bargaining power to the purchaser will come because the countries like maybe Venezuela, Nigeria, those who are really starved of the US dollar will be selling the crude at any price.So, I am not expecting that to happen for Q1, but Q2 I won't be surprised to see the GRM getting expanded by USD 1-1.5 per barrel and that will be seen quite positive because Q1 numbers probably may not factor in anything from the telecom operations. Either company may not disclose that or even if the company reports that, it will not be seen significant. So, difficult to take a call on that.Coming on petrochemicals, because prices of petchem have seen to be stable because of the crude derivative or the raw material being the crude derivative seen to have softened. So, even there they have to pass through and I am not taking a very positive call on the gas exploration, on the British Petroleum (BP) press conference. If you just want to attribute some reason, you can always say that BP conference has happened and they are very bullish, Rs 40,000 crore investment, but quite positive, extremely positive on the refining margin and won't be surprised to see it expanding by about at least USD 1.5 per barrel in Q2 while Q2 has just begun.Anuj: What are your thoughts on CDSL, right now we all know that it is a fact that it was such a sought after issue that is playing out right now, but at Rs 340 what would be the call on CDSL and BSE as well?A: I won't be taking a positive view on CDSL for the simple reason that if you see the kind of growth which they have achieved of 57 percent in last financial year in terms of their business growth, inspite of that they have a market share of 44 percent. If you see the kind of transaction charges or maybe the charges which they are charging from the company being listed on the CDSL and NSDL, obviously that is seen shrinking. Always if you see, Sebi has always kept a watch on both depositories and kept on directing them to reduce the charges. So, I don&rsquo;t know how much really one can expect their business to grow.If I take a call on the expected EPS, I don't think that can be seen above Rs 10 or maybe that will hardly be touching double digit. So, can you give a P/E multiple of 35? I doubt because sometimes what happens that we see these kind of in fact I have said that on the listing day also that probably you may have an upside of Rs 300 but beyond that it will be difficult to take a call and now it is ruling at Rs 350. So, definitely it has gone in a risky zone because even NSDL which is the depository and having a 56 percent market share, will be seen quite aggressive and sooner or later maybe in the next couple of years, even they will go public.Coming rub off effect on BSE, BSE is holding 24 percent stake in the company and by virtue of that, the share price of BSE is moving up. However, can that argument again remain valid because 24 percent is a minority stake and you can't attribute the valuation criteria merely on that because the divestment or the offer for sale in CDSL has happened at the instance of Sebi or maybe the regulations because BSE had to bring it down, their stake till 24 percent and that is what has happened.So, I won't be just taking a positive view on BSE also because the kind of cap on the charges and all sort of things and in my view because take the case of MCX where we have been taking a positive view, at least one can argue that the options are getting introduced and if they introduce the options in one commodity because Sebi has allowed only one commodity to be chosen by one commodity exchange, at least you have a very big trigger of new option getting introduced in the commodity market which can see their turnover increasing by 60 percent. So, unless and until you have some incremental income growth to be seen in CDSL, or BSE, I won&rsquo;t be chasing the momentum at the current level.Surabhi: Has something changed fundamentally in terms of pricing; you have been telling us about the UP situation, but a lot of diverse sugar stocks are running up today.A: I have been saying this for last one week and in my recommendations in this last one week or CNBC Awaaz and CNBC-TV18, maybe three or four have been the recommendations of sugar. Now, again, let me reiterate and repeat the things what has happened, in the month of June there was destocking happening at the dealers level, distributor&rsquo;s level and retailers level and that has seen virtually sugar stocks getting exhausted. Now, if you see the situation, the kind of renewed orders are seeing that has already seen the prices having increased by Rs 0.60 to Rs 0.75 per kilogram in the UP.In Bihar the prices have moved beyond Rs 37-37.50 per kilogram. That means there the prices have moved up by Rs 1 per kilogram. Now, whatever information which I have, that the cabinet is preparing a note of increasing the import duty from 40 percent to 50 percent, and that note should be out in maybe in the next one week or so, and apart from that, the global white sugar prices which fell to a low of USD 420 per tonne have started improving. So, if you take the situation going forward, the kind of inventory, the situation is very low on the inventory front. Except for UP sugar mills, no other mills are holding any inventory whether in Maharashtra, Karnataka, or Tamil Nadu.So, even the sugar from UP is coming altogether to the Southern part of India and I won&rsquo;t be surprised to see the sugar prices further increasing by Rs 1. If you have the huge inventory carried by all these companies, in fact I have estimated and given the inventory gain about Rs 250 crore in Triveni Engineering, about Rs 200 crore in Dalmia Bharat Sugar, Rs 225 crore in Dwarikesh Sugar, I think these inventory gain is going to get hardened and situation going forward again is looking very robust. Maharashtra probably for the next season will record 70 percent production growth in the sugar because last year or in the current season, sugar production was low.So, you have umpteen number of positive triggers which are in fact I sometimes feel that market was unable to catch any of this positive trigger and I have been repeatedly saying for last one week and I continue to have my positive bias and I won&rsquo;t be surprised to see the UP based sugar mills, these four or five sugar stocks moving up by about 15 percent in next couple of months from the current levels.\n",

If one does not own Reliance, one should. However, now as we speak, after that small correction Reliance has turned up and it is giving a sense that it is going towards Rs 1600. So in any case and even a short-term trader think of Reliance as a buy idea now.&amp;quot;&amp;quot;Asian Paints is a buying opportunity. It is a favourite stock of mine. A small correction is probably over; fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) should outperform and would be the reason why the Nifty goes up, if it does, FMCG and Reliance,&amp;quot; he said.&amp;quot;I am not very sure about the banks. The banks could go up, they may do minor contribution, I do not know. Apart from Asian Paints we have DLF. DLF had a nice corrections, small, mild and then a flat trading range and it is now breaking out of that range. So there is something going on in DLF which is worth buying.&amp;quot;&amp;quot;Autos is an outperformer. Hero Moto has done well and it is now on the verge of breaking after a small correction. There are a lot of good quality stocks that have corrected together with the Nifty and are now giving a sense of breaking out. So if at all a Nifty trade is taken, as I suggested, it should be only on the long side for me,&amp;quot; he added.&amp;quot;There are two short ideas - Arvind, which is going through some distribution. These are short selling ideas, try to keep them intraday and GAIL India; it is relatively weak but short selling should be done only intraday.&amp;quot;&amp;quot;It is possible that Lupin is turning around but yesterday was the first day that it saw a rally after months of decline. So I would rather wait. Pharmaceutical is bottoming out, it is difficult to say one day is enough but it is worth watching. I wouldn't buy it now.&amp;quot;&amp;quot;I do not have much conviction in ITC. I think it will go sideways. It will go up on one day and go down. There was a big rally. It could require weeks to consolidate and get out of that consolidation. Jet Airways is also a buying opportunity for the day.&amp;quot;&amp;quot;Like most other NBFCs there seems to be more run up possible in Shriram Transport Finance Corporation.&amp;quot;Disclaimer: Reliance Industries Ltd. is the sole beneficiary of Independent Media Trust which controls Network18 Media &amp;amp;amp; Investments Ltd\n",

Big Tree owns and operates BookMyShow platform. In a regulatory filing, Network18 said: &amp;quot;The consideration for the slump sale is Rs 6.7 lakh and has been determined on the basis of valuation carried out by EY.&amp;quot;Burrp is India's oldest food-tech business and currently lists over 56,000 restaurants across 12 cities.Burrp's revenue during FY2016-17 was Rs 56.67 lakh accounting for 0.69 per cent of Network18's turnover. The net worth as on March 31, 2017 stood at a negative Rs 28.89 crore, Network18 said.It further said considering the &amp;quot;insignificant contribution&amp;quot; of Burrp to revenue and the investments and the focus required to be made, Network18 had decided to divest the Burrp business.&amp;quot;The transaction is at arms' length basis and being a slump sale does not have any impact on the shareholding pattern of the company,&amp;quot; Network18 said.It added that the transfer will be effective from July 1.Founded in 2006, Burrp was a prominent player in the restaurant discovery space until it lost ground to competitor Zomato.BookMyShow has been focusing on transforming into a complete entertainment destination as it faces competition from new players like Paytm.&amp;quot;Movie going in India is a social activity and food is an integral part of it.

            "According to Moody's, the planned investment will increase RIL's exposure to Indian gas business which is extremely challenging.\n",
            "Reliance Industries' planned USD 6 billion investment to monetise gas finds in KG-D6 block will increase its exposure to the extremely challenging Indian gas business that is fraught with delays and retrospective changes in regulation, Moody's Investor Service said today.Reliance Industries(RIL) and its partner BP Plc of the UK last week announced that they are moving ahead with development of three fields in the KG-D6 block off the east coast of India. Investment of Rs 40,000 crore in the development of the fields is expected to produce 30-35 million cubic meters of gas a day (mmscmd) by year 2020-2022.&amp;quot;The planned investment will increase RIL's exposure to Indian gas business, which is extremely challenging given the delays in regulatory approvals, retrospective changes in regulations and slow resolution of disputes. RIL is already in arbitration with the regulator for costs previously incurred in the KG-D6 block,&amp;quot; Moody's said in its Issuer Comment.It said, given the regulatory environment, the timing of both the investments and cash flows from the project remains uncertain.&amp;quot;Two fields in the KG-D6 block that are already producing gas have seen a sharp decline in production of 60 mmscmd in 2010 to 7.8 mmscmd in 2017. The company has attributed the decline to more-than-expected complexity of the reservoirs. If the new fields also exhibit the same kind of complexity, the cash flows from the project could be much lower,&amp;quot; it said.RIL-BP estimate that the fields have 3 trillion cubic feet of discovered gas resources, which could be monetised with these investments.The investment is subject to approval by the Government of the development plans which RIL and BP plan to submit before end of 2017.The companies will only move forward when the development plans are approved by the government and their respective board of directors.&amp;quot;We expect the development plans will be approved in stages and the investments will be mostly back ended,&amp;quot; it said.RIL owns 60 per cent interest in the block and its share of investment will be Rs 24,000 crore. &amp;quot;We expect minimal investments in fiscal ending March 2018 and the annual investments will be about Rs 6,000 crore after that, which will increase borrowings and leverage,&amp;quot; Moody's said.While relative to RIL's total EBITDA of Rs 56,800 crore in fiscal 2017, the amount will have little impact on its credit metrics, the annual investment amount is disproportionately higher than the cash flows being generated by its upstream segment.RIL's upstream segment reported a pre-tax loss of Rs 1,600 crore in fiscal 2017.&amp;quot;This implies that the upstream business will drain cash from the rest of the business from fiscal 2018 until production begins from these blocks. This adds further drag on RIL's refining and petrochemical businesses which are already supporting the company's Rs 3 lakh crore (USD 47 billion) capex program over last four years in its energy and telecom businesses,&amp;quot; Moody's said.Currently, RIL is only getting USD 2.5 per million British thermal unit for its current gas production from the KG-D6 block. But the new fields are entitled to a higher rate, which is capped at USD 5.56.RIL-BP plan to award soon the contracts for development of the first field &ndash; R-Series, deep water gas fields located in water-depths of more than 2,000 meters, approximately 70 km offshore.The companies expect to produce up to 12 mmscmd, with first production in 2020.&amp;quot;At current gas price ceiling of USD 5.5 per million Btu, this level of production can generate USD 860 million (Rs 5,500 crore) of annual revenues for the block.&amp;quot;If the three new fields together manage to achieve production volumes of 30-35 mmscmd of natural gas, they could generate annual revenues of USD 2.2-2.5 billion, of which RIL's share will be USD 1.3-1.5 billion,&amp;quot; it said.&ldquo;Reliance Industries Ltd. is the sole beneficiary of Independent Media Trust which controls Network18 Media &amp;amp;amp; Investments Ltd.&rdquo;.\n",

            "Reliance Industries has 60 percent participating interest in KG-D6 block while BP has 30 percent and Niko 10 percent.\n",
            "Moneycontrol NewsGlobal&nbsp;brokerage houses said the partnership between Reliance Industries and British Petroleum (BP) to develop discoveries in the KG-D6 block is a long term positive for RIL but revenue from Reliance Jio would be key in near-to-medium term. The stock recouped early losses to trade at Rs 1,385.75, up 0.09 percent from previous close, at 11:44 hours IST.RIL and BP on Thursday announced that they are moving forward to develop already-discovered deepwater gas fields, bringing new gas production for India. Both companies will award contracts to progress development of the 'R-series' deep water gas fields in block KG-D6 off the east coast of India.The project is expected to produce up to 12 million cubic metres of gas a day, coming to stream in 2020, the company said, adding development of three projects, with total investment of Rs 40,000 crore, is expected to bring in total 30-35 million cubic metres of gas a day new domestic gas production onstream, phased over 2020-2022.Reliance Industries has 60 percent participating interest in KG-D6 block while BP has 30 percent and Niko 10 percent.CLSA | Rating Buy | Target Rs 1,710The partnership has also been expanded beyond upstream to focus on fuel marketing, unconventional energy and new technology initiatives, to deliver value to customers.The two companies also advanced their collaboration beyond conventional upstream. Firstly, this venture will expand in conventional fuel and ATF marketing. Pertinently, BP already has a licence to market aviation turbine fuel and set up 3,500 fuel stations in India. Secondly, the partnership plans to also look at opportunities in unconventional fuels and low carbon energy sources. This should encompass solar, wind and gas amongst other things. Thirdly, the JV will look to employ digitisation and develop futuristic and innovative solutions to deliver disruptive value, which can also be taken to other parts of the world.Plan to develop existing discoveries in D6 is a long-term positive. At the same time, this new JV on downstream should remove any doubts on whether Reliance is focussed to expand in fuel marketing. Nonetheless, near-term stock performance will be driven by start of projects worth over USD 40 billion in the next 6-9 months. CLSA has reiterated buy call on the stock.Morgan Stanley | Rating Overweight | Target Rs 1,506RIL's announcement related to investment in upstream, which was slightly above expectations, while the collaboration with BP in expanding investment in conventional fuels, unconventional mobility solutions and addressing electrification, sets the tone for RIL's growth plans.Both upstream and fuel retail expansion have been well flagged; the overall growth in capex being around 10 percent above estimates. While there were limited details on retail fuel collaboration, BP has adopted a selective approach towards retail network expansion and it believes it will co-exist and not compete with incumbent retailers.Bank of America Merrill Lynch | Rating Neutral | Target Rs 1,450While it is good that RIL has decided to restart projects in D6, these are currently long dated projects.The new D6 fields could add USD 1.3 billion (2 percent) to RIL sum-of-the-parts, but more importantly drive core earnings growth post the ongoing chemical projects (in the FY21-22 period).The new energy partnership is still in early stages and needs definition. Spending, inflow on this will take time.In the near term, the RIL stock should depend on Reliance Jio's revenue fortunes, which may become clear only around September/December 2017. With 5 percent upside potential, it stayed neutral on the stock.JPMorgan | Rating Neutral | Target Rs 1,310Given that both announcements are more medium-term impact events, JPMorgan sees limited uplift to the near-term stock price.Given that the first of the incremental gas is not before 2020 and the full ramp up would be only in 2022, the research house sees limited financial impact till FY20.The capital spend of around USD 1 billion a year is also very manageable for RIL, it feels. The increase in KG-D6 investments comes together with increasing CBM investments by the company.While current gas prices are low, so are capital costs for developing these fields. RIL's ability to make counter cyclical investments is a key positive as it continues to de-risk the earnings profile from energy prices, JPMorgan said.Credit Suisse | Rating NeutralRIL/BP's a new strategic partnership, aiming to explore opportunities in differentiated fuels, mobility and low carbon businesses, is very preliminary. Credit Suisse does not see it impacting its RIL investment thesis at the moment.Capex, project timelines and peak output are broadly in line with prior RIL/BP guidance and already built into its models. Domestic E&amp;amp;amp;P only accounts for 4 percent of its RIL sum-of-the-parts.Disclosure: Reliance Industries Ltd. is the sole beneficiary of Independent Media Trust which controls Network18 Media &amp;amp;amp; Investments Ltd.\n",

            "Domestic gas is cheaper than imported gas. &ldquo;So good for the country and consumer, said RK Garg, Director-Finance, Petronet LNG.\n",
            "Reliance Industries and BP have announced a partnership to increase gas output form KG-D6 with an investment of Rs 40,000 crore. The question is what this means to gas importer and regasifier Petronet LNG.RK Garg, Director-Finance, Petronet LNG welcoming the new partnership between RIL and BP, says with the government targeting to increase the consumption of natural gas in the overall energy basket, there is a need for more domestic natural gas.Currently natural gas consumption is around 6.5 percent which has to go up to 15 percent, said Garg. Production of domestic gas would help leverage more LNG import because domestic gas is cheaper than imported gas. &ldquo;So good for the country and consumer,&rdquo; he said.On the business front, he says they are further looking to expand the Dahej Unit from 15 million tonnes (mt) to 17.5 mt by around 2019. The current 15 mt is fully available for usage and the Dahej plant along is meeting 70-80 percent of the country&rsquo;s imported gas requirement.Furthermore, he says the progress of Kochi to Mangalore pipeline is good under execution by Gail. So, if everything goes as per plan then by end of 2018 the pipeline would be read and the throughput at Kochi would increase.For Mangalore to Bangalore that is Kochi to Mangalore and then to Bangalore via Tamil Nadu, the discussions are still one, says Garg.Kochi refineries has been expanded and the volumes have now increased and FACT is of taking the volume right now. The current utilisation of Kochi is 13-14-15 percent as compared to 5 percent earlier. As of now there are two major consumers for Kochi that is FACT and BPCL and utilisation depends on their oftake.Going forward if profits are good and there is sufficient cash on the books, then shareholders would be duly rewarded via dividends but the decision will be taken by the Board, says Garg.Moreover, he clarified that the Saudi Arabia- Qatar standoff is not impacting their volume inflows and the entire volume is coming as planned.Disclaimer: Reliance Industries Ltd. is the sole beneficiary of Independent Media Trust which controls Network18 Media &amp;amp;amp; Investments Ltd.\n",

            "In an interview to CNBC-TV18, SP Tulsian of sptulsian.com shared his readings and outlook on the market outlook and specific stocks and sectors.\n",
            "In an interview to CNBC-TV18, SP Tulsian of sptulsian.com shared his readings and outlook on the market outlook and specific stocks and sectors.Below is the verbatim transcript of the interview.Sonia: First I wanted to ask you your view on Reliance Industries and what kind of net present value (NPV) up move are we essentially looking at post the announcements that came in yesterday?A: Yesterday I expressed my view post the press conference because if you take a call now, right now I won&rsquo;t be taking a call on the monetisation or the earnings calculation on 30-35 mmscmd which we will be seeing from three projects. However, 12 mmscmd is being considered that too that will start coming in from 2020. If you take a call because unless and until you have a price realisation, because there have been uncovered questions which have not been answered or there have been lot many things disconnect. One on the schedule or period of the capex of Rs 40,000 crore, but apart from that, the unanswered question is what kind of realisations we are expecting from the gas.Even if take USD 7.5 per mmbtu for the gas which will be seen from first of the field, i.e. &lsquo;R&rsquo; field, and if I take a 12 mmscmd as the production, the revenue is estimated, in fact I don&rsquo;t think that anyone has given the quantum of that which is very important, the turnover works out at Rs 8,000 crore and I don&rsquo;t think that the EBITDA of more than 40-45 percent can get expected. So, it is very difficult to take a call that what kind of investments because the investments amount having invested earlier on all these fields have not seen having yield any results.Rs 32 crore having invested in British Petroleum (BP), again both the promoters were silent on that that what has been the fate of the earlier investments having made and what will go into the amount of this Rs 40,000 crore on the field and off the field i.e. in the sea either for creating the fuel stations and all that and how much will be for the gas exploration. So, it is difficult to take a call.However, still if you want to take a call, I won&rsquo;t be taking it very significant, maybe an amount of Rs 20-25 can be attributed to the net present value, taking the value as of today discounting the 2020 earnings which I said which can yield an turnover of about Rs 8,300 crore calculating at the USD 7.5 realisation per mmbtu.Anuj: You have a stock idea for our viewers today?A: I am recommending Aksharchem. This is a dye and dye intermediates company. If you recall, last March 30, I have given the indications when suddenly the prices of dye and dye intermediates started moving in and this time also there are I won&rsquo;t name the two listed companies which may be affected but in Padra near Vadodara, the pollution problem is seen cropping up which will be seen negative for two of the companies, in fact three companies are getting affected severely because of that and I won&rsquo;t be surprised to see the stoppage of the production also. So, that will be seen as an advantage to Aksharchem because Aksharchem is a fully pollution control compliant and second company is Bhageria Industries on which I am director as a matter of disclosure.Both the companies are in no way affected. I am not saying that because I am director but that is the ground situation. Two listed companies which are operating in Padra, they are facing the pollution problems. So, whenever these kinds of events happen, you have to foresee these events, when they happen suddenly you see the prices of H-acid and vinyl sulphone starts moving up which are the two critical raw material for making dyes. In fact for making dyes, both are dye intermediates. Aksharchem is a market leader in vinyl sulphone controlling 45 percent of the market from India to exports and that is the reason the FY17 has been excellent for all these dye intermediate makers.If you see the company in FY17, they have shown a topline growth of 40 percent to about Rs 265 crore, but PAT has tripled. PAT has shown more than 200 percent growth. PAT has increased from Rs 17 crore to Rs 52 crore. So any pollution control lapses on part of the other three plants which are operating in Padra, Vadodara of which two are listed, if that has any reflection, the major orders will flow to the company like Aksharchem and all that. Apart from that, the company is carrying out the capex of about Rs 175 crore. They are the world leader in CPC Green which is dye about controlling 10 percent of the market and they are putting up fresh capacity in the dye and dye intermediate space.H-acid 1,200 tonne per annum, violet 2,300 tonne per annum, CPC Green 2,200 tonner per annum, total capex of about Rs 175 crore to be met from the internal accruals. I am expecting that probably in next six to eight months, or 6-12 months, all the products will go operational. So, taking all this into consideration, debt free balance sheet, promoter stake of 70 percent, EPS was Rs 71 in FY17 which I am expecting to move up in this year also, I have not quantified the amount. So, taking all this into consideration, share is now ruling below Rs 760 looks a good buy and can move to a level of Rs 945 in next six months or so.Disclosure: Reliance Industries Ltd. is the sole beneficiary of Independent Media Trust which controls Network18 Media &amp;amp;amp; Investments Ltd.\n",

After the past few months of stable services, Jio&rsquo;s focus should shift to monetisation but it remains to be seen if it goes from the current 66 percent discount to full tariff in one go or in steps,&rdquo; it added.Apart from this, the likely start of its fixed broadband service should enable it to expand its target market beyond 4G smartphone users and add legs to its growth, it added. &ldquo;This would allow Jio to target nearly 30% of Indian mobile data users who still prefer feature phones,&rdquo; the report added.Along with the likely start of its fixed broadband service, this should enable it to expand its target market beyond 4G smartphone users and add legs to its growth.The next big event for the stock could be the annual general meeting, the report stated. &ldquo;The AGM, possibly in July, could be a key event for further announcements on Jio, projects and future cash use,&rdquo; the report stated.The stock has risen around 2 percent in the past one month, while its three-day gain stood at 2.3 percent.At 09:19 hrs Reliance Industries was quoting at Rs 1,344.45, up Rs 14.55, or 1.09 percent on the BSE. It touched an intraday high of Rs 1,352.00 and an intraday low of Rs 1,342.05.Disclaimer: Reliance Industries Ltd. is the sole beneficiary of Independent Media Trust which controls Network18 Media &amp;amp;amp; Investments Ltd.\n",

            "Amid concerns over job losses in USD 155 billion IT sector, industry lobby Assocham today said this is the time for outsourcing companies &amp;quot;to look inward&amp;quot; and focus on the domestic opportunity to curtail layoffs.&amp;quot;It is time our industry bellwethers looked a bit inward now. It is also time to redraw strategy that gives a good look at the home market, which can more than make up, at least in the short to medium term, for the possible dent on jobs in the disruptive overseas markets,&amp;quot; it said in a note.The information technology and business process management industry has grown at a healthy clip for nearly two decades, but protectionist policies in the west and increased automation have led to job losses in the recent past with some analysts estimating layoffs at over 2 lakh per year.Even as IT majors say that Indian opportunity is very volatile, contributes only single digits to the revenue and has problems surrounding payments, the industry lobby said PM's Jan Dhan Yojana and Aadhar based service delivery models offer interesting opportunities.It said 60 per cent of the current work done by the Indian IT industry is for global companies in the banking, financial services and insurance sector.Data generated by PMJDY and its linkages with Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) can be a &amp;quot;delight for different set of analytics&amp;quot; and can be used to help the fast moving consumer goods, auto, telecom, insurance, agri sectors, it said.An increased focus on the domestic front will be a &amp;quot;win-win&amp;quot; for both the country as well as the IT industry, it said, calling for a high level task force consisting of IT industry and the Government.The lobby's secretary general D S Rawat claimed &amp;quot;lakhs of new jobs&amp;quot; can be created through the focus on domestic opportunity which can make up for the losses due to upheavals in global markets and changing technologies.The note comes months after Reliance Industries' Mukesh Ambani called the protectionist policies in US as a blessing in disguise for India.(US President Donald) Trump can actually be a blessing in disguise. The domestic IT industry can focus on solving problems right here, which is a huge market,&amp;quot; Ambani had said in February.\n",

Often when such moves happen, there is more downside. Maybe say above Rs 1,550, if we can move above Rs 1,550 you would say that maybe that negativity is over. However, other than that, all rallies towards Rs 1,550 should be used to sell.&amp;quot;&amp;quot;For the moment I think JK Cement seems to be breaking out, also Kesoram Industries. So, smaller cement stocks are kind of doing well. So, probably look at JK Cement moving further higher towards Rs 1,300-1,350,&amp;quot; he said.&amp;quot;Reliance Industries had a large 2-3 percent move. All of that is getting taken out, so, Reliance is breaking the low of that 2 percent move we had the other day.&amp;quot;&amp;quot;Hindustan Unilever (HUL) has not shown any follow through from that big bar that we got the other day. Axis Bank is now breaking levels of Rs 500 repeatedly. So, that takes care of pretty much the Nifty as well as the Bank Nifty.&amp;quot;&amp;quot;Midcaps continue to rally, so, that is where upside is still possible.

            "India presented a long-delayed plan to industry officials for selecting private arms manufacturers to help build an indigenous defence industry, a government document seen by Reuters showed.Local companies will be chosen as strategic partners that can combine with foreign firms to manufacture single-engine fighter aircraft, helicopters, submarines and armoured vehicles, according to the document.New Delhi hopes the yet-to-be-finalised &amp;quot;Strategic Partnership&amp;quot; model will boost the role of private companies, grow India's small defence industry, which is dominated by state-run companies, and end its role as the world's largest arms importer.Officials from Tata Sons, Reliance Industries, Larsen and Toubro and Adani Enterprises among others attended a presentation made by defence and finance minister Arun Jaitley on Thursday, a defence ministry official said.New Delhi will use a range of financial and technical criteria to pick companies for &amp;quot;design, development and manufacturing of strategic (defence) platforms for future,&amp;quot; the document showed, without naming any company.The ministry of defence said in a statement that Jaitley had met with industry representatives on Thursday to discuss the proposed model but did not go into specific details.Prime Minister Narendra Modi has vowed to reverse India's dependence on imports by building a local manufacturing industry. The government is forecast to spend $250 billion on modernisation of its armed forces over the next decade.Industry experts say delays in finalising procurement policies have undermined India's efforts to get local, largely inexperienced, companies to tie up with foreign manufacturers, a necessary step if domestic firms are to utilise the latest technology.Foreign manufacturers like Lockheed Martin, Boeing, BAE Systems and Saab are looking to India as one of the biggest sources of future growth. Saab and Lockheed are both pitching for an estimated 200 to 250 fighter jets that the Indian Air Force says it needs.Ankur Gupta, Vice President, Aerospace and Defence at consultancy EY said the strategic partnership policy would &amp;quot;give the much-needed impetus to private companies and build their business case to make serious long-term investments in India.&amp;quot;Among the basic requirements under the plan, Indian firms must have a consolidated turnover for each of the last three years of more than 40 billion rupees ($621 million) to qualify, the document said.Six Indian companies will be shortlisted, and will then choose among several foreign partners.Indian companies will be permitted to speak with multiple foreign firms to work out a tie-up, but can only offer to work together with one of them at the time of bidding.The helicopters, submarines, armoured fighter vehicles and fighter jet orders are expected to be multi-billion-dollar deals.\n",

            "Here is a list of top five stocks to buy based on technical factors in the short term.\n",
            "Pushkaraj Sham KanitkarGEPL CapitalThe market created a fresh 52-week high last week on the back of a stellar performance of heavyweights such as ICICI Bank standalone and the Bank Nifty. Nonetheless, the later part of the week saw a correction in the other heavyweight&rsquo;s pack that dragged down the index to close down below the 9,300 mark.The macro-technical alert in the form of break in international commodities that was raised seems to have acted, to say the least. This brings us to the juncture, where a risk-off status may set in for next few days.This may set into a correction towards 9,190 levels, followed by the 6-week low placed at 9,020. After a stellar move seen in the past few weeks, the profit booking in the heavyweights is certainly welcome; though it seems quite evenly balanced.Here is a list of top five stocks to buy based on technical factors in the short term:Indiabulls Housing Finance: BUY| Target Rs 1300| Stop Loss Rs 993| Return 17%The stock is an outperformer within the market and the NBFC pack as the scrip has sustained the correction very well. A breakout of 6 weeks of consolidation above the Rs 1,000 mark has led it onto a new 52-week high on the back of good volume pickup.We expect a move up to 1175 (around 5%) from current levels, which if crossed further may move onto Rs 1,300. A stop loss maybe placed a bit into the consolidation zone placed at Rs993.Avenue Supermarts: BUY| Target Rs 900| Stop Loss Rs 786 | Return 11%After proving to be a double-bagger on the listing, the scrip had shown a stellar move till mid-April. The prices have consolidated over the last 3 weeks in a band of Rs806-720 while maintaining a strong undertone which is a positive sign.It has moved on to a fresh high of Rs814.40, on large volumes over the past few days. The same is accompanied by a surge in momentum.We expect a move onto Rs850 and then extrapolated to Rs900 with a stop loss placed half way into the breakout band placed at Rs786.ZEE Entertainment Enterprises: SELL| Target Rs 467| Stop Loss Rs 537| Return 7%The stock witnessed a classic head &amp;amp;amp; shoulders breakdown, below the Rs511 mark, accompanied by high volumes is a big red flag in the scrip prices.The head to the neckline is defined by around 44 pints (511 to 555) spanning over two shoulders created in March &amp;amp;amp; Mat 2017. The target maybe placed around Rs467 mark (44 points below the neckline).A fair risk-reward seems possible with a stop loss for the trade be placed at Rs537, a bit above the right shoulder.Biocon: SELL| Target Rs 972| Stop Loss Rs 1086| Return 6%A gradual price move from March 2017, has met with a faster retracement, wherein prices have broken below the 2-month low of around Rs1,042.The said retracement has taken place on the back of Heavy volumes (around 4-5 times of averages). Prices in the recent few days have remained extremely volatile with the majority of the days showing a negative candle, an indication of consistent selling at every higher level.A dipping RSI around 39 indicates the waning strength in the prices. Prices are ripe for a correction onto the 200-DMA placed at 972. The stop may be placed a bit above the 38.1% retracement of current fall at a level of Rs1,086.Reliance Industries: SELL| Target Rs 1,230| Stop Loss Rs 1,399| Return 7%In line with the overall weak trajectory in the commodities sector (a 1.75% correction in the index over the week), the prices have remained falling off the cliff over the whole of last 2 weeks.The last week saw a break below the 5-week low placed at Rs1,347 accompanied by a substantial rise in the delivered quantity indicating a consistent selling at higher levels with the prices waning all through the week.The RSI after having reached overbought levels around 72 has softened off to 45, showing a waning strength. The prices are on course for a break below the gap created in March 2017 between 1325-1311, that may be followed by a correction towards the 3-month LOWS around the 1230 mark.The bearish view would stand negated only on a closing above the 5th May&rsquo;s high placed at the Rs1,399 mark.Disclaimer: The author is AVP - Technical Research at GEPL Capital.

            "In an interview to CNBC-TV18 technical analyst, Ashwani Gujral of ashwanigujral.com shared his reading and outlook on the market&nbsp;and also gave recommendations on various stocks.Below is the verbatim transcript of the interview.Anuj: Quite a rocky week specially towards the end. On Friday we did see the market closing at low point but is it presenting a buying opportunity, what would be your prognosis for Nifty and Bank Nifty now?A: On the Nifty we are still rangebound. We haven&rsquo;t broken down from the range although today looked like a fairly strong down day but I would think that as long as 9,250-9,270 holds on, maybe this is more a midcap type correction. The other thing is that ICICI Bank has had a strong breakout and if Reliance can probably bounce back from support, the largecap indices could be supported.The other thing is that this new ordinance which has come out, the Bank Nifty did not react too badly to that. So it is possible that the PSU bank rally resumes, the corporate lender rally basically resumes. So I am not too negative on either the Nifty or the Bank Nifty, you could have more sideways for sure but possibly the midcaps could have a bit of a deeper downmove. I would still buy closer to 9,250 on the Nifty.Sonia: For next week, since you mentioned public sector undertaking (PSU) banks, are there any fresh buys that you will recommend in any of the PSU names either the frontliners or even the midcaps?A: All of these guys, Bank of India (BoI), Union Bank, Canara Bank, while they did come off from the highs, they did not close at the lows. So if you get any sort of decline from here maybe 3-5 percent style decline, you should buy into them because if the market would have taken the policy negatively, these guys should have been down 8-10 percent. So today&rsquo;s reaction is quite positive. They may not immediately start rallying but I think people are still buying into them and we should see higher levels on all of these midcap PSU banks particularly.Anuj: Your own stock ideas for next week?A: Given that oil is weak, I am taking on stocks which are oil sensitive. Berger Paints can be bought out there, we are expecting targets of Rs 300 on Berger Paints. Most paint companies have done well, even Asian Paints. Similarly on Jet Airways, we are expecting targets closer to Rs 600, again aviation did well although the market was under pressure. These are stocks which can outperform even in a market which is a bit soft. On microfinance, I think the way Ujjivan Financial Services has broken down below its 200-day moving average (DMA), we could see levels of Rs 260-280. So this is a short sell that people can play into.Sonia: There is a new segment that we have introduced where we will try to interact with our twitter followers. We have a couple of queries coming in. Kamal Arora has written to us saying that he has purchased 100 shares of Glenmark at Rs 750 and he says he can hold it for one year, should he hold or sell?A: First of all it is important to understand that this is not the time of pharmaceuticals or IT. So he is making money because Glenmark happens to be in a Rs 750-950 type of range. Each time it gets to Rs 950, you need to exit. Yes, there will come a time when pharma stocks get back into a bull market but this is not their bull market. So if you are making money, take it off. Again enter at Rs 750 and it looks like you will get there fairly soon.Anuj: We have Saptarshi De and he has bought two of your favourite names, Sobha Developers at Rs 390 and HDFC at Rs 1,380 and he is a long-term investor.A: He has bought both stocks, which are performing in this current bull market. Sobha he can easily keep Rs 360 type of a stop, real estate will re-resume its rally, the Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act (RERA) impact will still get factored in and things will get cleaned out in that space. I would think Sobha can easily double from here. It has got clean balance sheet, it is a good developer, so he has bought it fairly near the bottom so nothing to worry on that.Similarly, HDFC, again good price to buy and housing finance remains a theme, although it will not move like a Can Fin Home but chances are as long as this bull market sustains, housing finance will be a theme if you want to add on any declines towards Rs 1,500-1,520, it is a good place to add and I would expect Rs 1,700-1,750 in the times to come on HDFC.Sonia: Megh Kenia says that Bhushan Steel after the new steel policy coming in today, is it a buy or a sell from current level?A: Bhushan Steel has other problems other than the steel policy and metals are not doing very well. So if he has recently bought it maybe keep a stop of Rs 70-72 and while it is in a decent uptrend, but given the way the sector is moving, I am not very positive. If metal start to turnaround, he could get Rs 90-95 but I like to be in spaces where the sector is outperforming. So I would still be much rather trying to buy reactions on non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) rather than bet on metals because metals overall are not looking very good.Disclosure: Network 18, which publishes moneycontrol.com, is a part of the Reliance Group.\n",

            "Reliance Industries will sell the natural gas it produces from coal seams in Madhya Pradesh to its own units in Gujarat and Maharashtra at USD 4.23 per million British thermal units.\n",
            "Reliance Industries will sell the natural gas it produces from coal seams in Madhya Pradesh to its own units in Gujarat and Maharashtra at USD 4.23 per million British thermal units.After last month's government decision to give coal bed methane (CBM) producers freedom to discover market price, RIL invited bids from users of gas.Five companies including RIL participated in the bidding process, according to the bid evaluation report the company posted on its website.The bidders besides RIL were Deepak Fertilizer &amp;amp;amp; Petrochemicals Corp Ltd, state-owned gas utility GAIL India Ltd and GMR's Rajahmundry and Vemagiri power plants.While RIL bid USD 4.23 per mmBtu price for using the gas at its petrochemical plants at Patalganga and Nagothane in Maharashtra and Jamnagar in Gujarat, Deepak Fertilizer was a close second bidding USD 4.159. GAIL put in a bid of USD 4.009 while GMR quoted USD 2.48 per mmBtu for both the plants.The price discovered is almost the same as USD 4.205 per mmBtu price fixed for RIL's eastern offshore KG-D6 gas field for first five years of production beginning April 2009.A sixth bid from Asahi India Glass Ltd was rejected as it quoted for 0.51 million standard cubic meters per day (mmscmd) which &amp;quot;exceeds the available CBM gas volume for sale of 0.40 mmscd,&amp;quot; the evaluation report of its CBM gas bids said.The bid document stipulates that &amp;quot;the volume quoted by the bidder shall not be lesser than 0.05 mmscmd or shall not exceed 0.40 mmscmd (approximate volume expected to be available for sale),&amp;quot; the report said, adding that in view of this the bid by Asahi was not considered.The six bids put in a total requirement of 2.16 mmscmd as against the available volume of 0.40 mmscmd.Through the April 13 notification, the oil ministry had stated that a CBM producer has to call for open bids for sale of coal gas and seek price quotes to discover the market price.The process prescribed was the same as the one RIL had run in 2012 to discover a price for CBM gas it is to produce in Madhya Pradesh. Back in 2012, it had sought bids for 3.5 mmscmd (as against 0.40 mmscmd put on offer this time) of coal gas from its Sohagpur CBM block in Madhya Pradesh at a benchmarked rate at 12.67 percent of JCC, or Japan Customs-Cleared Crude, plus USD 0.26 per million British thermal unit. The formula was the same at which Petronet LNG, a joint venture of public sector oil companies, whose chairman is the oil secretary, used to buy long-term liquefied natural gas (LNG) from Qatar.At USD 100 per barrel oil price prevalent that year, CBM from RIL's Madhya Pradesh block was to cost USD 12.93 per mmBtu. At USD 55 a barrel rate currently, it would cost USD 7.2. That formula was, however, rejected by the ministry even though 59 valid bids seeking about 70 mmscmd of gas were received in the open tender.This time, RIL sought bids in form of a a deductible from Platts DES West India price of USD 7.659 per MMBtu.RIL bid deducting 3.429 per MMBtu while Deepak put in (-) 3.5 bid. GAIL quoted a deduction of 3.65 and GMR 5.179.&amp;quot;In the event of market-discovered price being less than the price notified by the Petroleum Planning Analysis Cell (PPAC) under the New Domestic Natural Gas Pricing Guidelines, 2014, the royalty and production level payment (PLP) shall be paid on the basis of the latter,&amp;quot; the CBM pricing policy notified last month said.The PPAC notified price of gas for April 1 to September 30 at USD 2.48 per mmBtu and the same for difficult areas is USD 5.56 per mmBtu, lower than the rate in RIL formula.&amp;quot;Sale of CBM to any affiliate of the contractor is permitted, in the event the contractor cannot identify any buyer following the procedure (of open bidding),&amp;quot; the policy said, adding that the reasons for sale to affiliates will have to be notified to the Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH).Disclosure: Reliance Industries Ltd. is the sole beneficiary of Independent Media Trust which controls Network18 Media &amp;amp;amp; Investments Ltd.\n",

            "Madhuchanda DeyMoneycontrol ResearchIn the past ten days while the earnings reports of Reliance Industries, Axis Bank, Kotak Bank and Maruti hogged the limelight, there were quite a few interesting results from some very well- known and some lesser known names as well that caught our attention.Financial sector clearly put on a stellar performance with RBL Bank and The Federal Bank posting a strong show. But being the best performing banks, it didn&rsquo;t come as a surprise.The capital market focused entities like JM Financial and Motilal Oswal also posted a strong show.The company that deserves a mention albeit its strong price performance is GIC Housing Finance. The company will be a big beneficiary of the government&rsquo;s affordable housing push. The average ticket-size of its loan is around Rs 16 lakhs and 50 percent of the loan exposure is below Rs 15 lakhs. Hence, the interest subsidy from the government will have a positive rub-off on volumes. However, the valuation at 3.2X FY17 book warrants cooling.DCM Shriram and Coromandel International &ndash; both rural-focused entities -- deserve a closer look with a forecast of good rains this year. The quarter gone by saw commendable performance from these entities. UPL (United Phosphorous) too impressed with its numbers.The other noteworthy numbers from the midcap universe included Supreme Petrochem, Supreme Industries, Tata Sponge Iron, Hatsun Agro, Hyderabad Industries, Deep Industries, Rushil D&eacute;cor and Menon Bearings.Rajan Raheja Group promoted Supreme Petrochem is&nbsp;the largest&nbsp;producer and exporter of&nbsp;polystyrene polymer&nbsp;in India. Supreme Industries is India's largest plastic processor based in Mumbai. However, valuation comfort is warranted for fresh accumulation in these stocks.Tata Sponge Iron benefitted from the revival in manufacturing activities in the domestic market that resulted in a rebound in sponge iron prices. Steel scrap, a substitute of sponge iron, is trading at a significant premium that should drive demand. Finally, the company is debt-free with a cash per share of Rs 369.The CK Birla Group promoted HIL (Hyderabad Industries) produces roofing solutions, panels, walling blocks, plywood substitutes, high-quality pipes and fittings, and industrial insulation. Despite the 40 percent run-up in the stock, the valuation looks reasonable.Menon Bearings produces bi-metal engine bearings, bushes and thrust washers for light and heavy automobile engines, two-wheeler engines and compressors for refrigerators and air conditioners. It also offers aluminium die casting component under &ldquo;ALKOP&rdquo; brand. The company derives 78 percent of revenue from bearing and bushes and 22 percent from ALKOP. The share of exports stands at 28 percent. &nbsp;An interesting idea that warrants some patience after the 55 percent run-up in the past year.Rushil D&eacute;cor, which is into the manufacturing of laminated sheets and MDF and Hatsun Agro is the largest private sector dairy company in India. Both these companies have been a favourite of savvy investors for a while and despite their strong show, valuation doesn&rsquo;t lend comfort.We would also like to highlight some decent numbers from some completely unknown names.Tracking the unknown names for discovering future winners is key to investing success. Hence, all the winners spotted here deserve attention.(Disclosure: RIL, which owns Reliance Jio, also owns Network18 and&nbsp;moneycontrol.com).\n",

However, it is probably sideways type of phase; I think Rs 1,350-1,360, those are levels where you should try to get into Reliance. It is doing a 100 point range which is quite natural after a 40 percent rally.&amp;quot;&amp;quot;While Hindalco Industries has probably gone to previous highs, but in metals overall, the rally has not really started. You need a good global situation where metals perform. I don&rsquo;t think that is likely for the moment; more likely is the NBFC rally continuing, but definitely all of them are down 7-10 percent. So, these are good levels to buy into them,&amp;quot; he said.&amp;quot;All products in this country for infrastructure are not worth looking at but infrastructure as a whole is looking up. So, chances are that once IRB Infrastructure can get past Rs 280-285 zone which is a significant high, I think you could have rallies right up to Rs 350-360.

So, chances are IRB Infra, Larsen and Toubro, Hindustan Construction, etc., all of these are likely to move higher.&amp;quot;&amp;quot;I don&rsquo;t think United Breweries is worth looking at.

            "Citi maintained its buy call on the stock with an increase in its bull case target to Rs 1,923 due to higher Jio valuation and lower peak net debt.\n",
            "Moneycontrol NewsReliance Industries witnessed a surge of over 3 percent intraday on Tuesday as investors cheered the company&rsquo;s better-than-expected results. Analysts, too, have given the numbers their thumbs-up as well.The petrochemical major's quarterly earnings beat analysts' expectations on Monday as profit on a standalone basis grew by 1.6 percent sequentially to Rs 8,151 crore for January-March quarter. Net income on consolidated basis rose 7 percent to Rs 8,053 crore QoQ.Standalone revenue from operations during the quarter increased 12 percent quarter-on-quarter to Rs 74,598 crore while consolidated revenue soared 10.33 percent to Rs 92,889 crore, the company said in its filing.Reliance reported gross refining margin for the quarter at USD 11.50 a barrel, which was far ahead of analysts' estimates of USD 11 a barrel and outperformed Singapore complex margins by USD 5.2 a barrel. It had posted GRM at 10.8 a barrel in December quarter.The company&rsquo;s stock was in the news recently when it surpassed Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) in terms of market capitalisation and also became the most valued company in the country. Analysts have largely given positive calls on the stock, driven by a reduction of capex cycle in sight and better metrics in the results.Citi maintained its buy call on the stock with an increase in its bull case target to Rs 1,923 due to higher Jio valuation and lower peak net debt. It believes that the company&rsquo;s outperformance could sustain as the earnings are at an inflection point. Among key risks to the stock are weakening in refining fundamentals and global petrochemical spreads, the research firm added.Analysts at the firm termed the company&rsquo;s March quarter performance as strong, with the standalone EBITDA being 3 percent ahead of estimates. Meanwhile, the profit after tax (PAT) was largely in line, it said. Gross refining margins of USD 11.5 per barrel were above its estimates, it said.On the company&rsquo;s capex plans, it sees standalone capex being lesser than USD 2.5 billion in FY18. Jio&rsquo;s capex in the first quarter of the fiscal will be similar to March quarter before declining sharply, it said.Nomura maintained its buy call on the stock as well, but with an unchanged target price of Rs 1,540. The brokerage house observed that the net profit was 1-2 percent ahead of its estimates, driven by lower tax rate. It too feels that the recent outperformance of the company could sustain.However, the earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) and profit before tax (PBT) were below its estimates on the back of higher depreciation and lower other income. These numbers too were partly offset by lower finance costs, it added.Going forward, it sees earnings growing ahead once Jio, petchem and refining expansion projects start to deliver. It expects consolidated EBITDA/PAT CAGR of 19 percent/15 percent, respectively over FY16-20.Meanwhile, it observed that high capex on Jio continued during the quarter and expects similar capex in Q1 of this fiscal. The near-term focus will be on addition in customers of Jio. Having said that, it feels that the large capex cycle is coming to an end.Bank of America Merrill Lynch has downgraded the stock to neutral, but increased the target price to Rs 1,450 from Rs 1,375. The global brokerage firm observed that the firm&rsquo;s March quarter net profit was 9 percent above estimates, while refining beat was led by GRM.Analysts at the firm now have the focus on Jio&rsquo;s success and the capex cycle. They believe that a further rerating on the stock is contingent on a successful Jio P&amp;amp;amp;L as well as falling capex. It further added that while capex could decline, there is limited visibility on a successful Jio P&amp;amp;amp;L.The stock could find support from growth in Jio&rsquo;s monthly subscribers, while weak margin, project startup hiccups and high capex were the key risks, Bank of America Merrill Lynch said.Morgan Stanley, meanwhile, has an overweight rating on the stock as it saw upside risks from improving energy margins as well as project executions. A steady project pipeline commissioning from FY18 should reduce the risk of further capex, it added.JPMorgan is neutral on the stock with an increased target price of Rs 1,310 from Rs 1,240. While the lower capex in its core business was positive, Jio was the key unknown element, it said. Further extension of discounts by Jio would be negative, it added.Rolling forward its valuation to FY19, Deutsche Bank raised its target by 10 percent to Rs 1,600. Lower downstream margins, policy vagaries were the key downside risks for stock, it said.The stock has moved around 12 percent in the past one month, while its three-day gain stood at 5 percent. At 11:04 hrs, Reliance Industries was quoting at Rs 1,437.90, up Rs 21.50, or 1.52 percent on the BSE. It touched a 52-week high of Rs 1,465.00.(Disclosure: Reliance Industries Ltd. is the sole beneficiary of Independent Media Trust which controls Network18 Media &amp;amp;amp; Investments Ltd.)\n",

So, possibly it could get bagged towards Rs 830-840. Similarly, as long as Reliance Capital remains above Rs 600, it is in a new zone and Rs 730-750 will happen over a period of time. However, I see the market rally now moving towards capex oriented stocks, so, my attention would move from financials to infrastructure,&amp;quot; he said.&amp;quot;There is news flow backing Biocon but overall if you see, both pharmaceutical and IT are not doing very well. Biocon had a great year last year, chances are it will consolidate for a bit before it makes the next move.&amp;quot;&amp;quot;Indiabulls Housing Finance is done with its correction and I would see new highs here. So, maybe targets of Rs 1,150-1,200 should be likely,&amp;quot; he added.Disclosure: Reliance Industries owns Network 18 that publishes Moneycontrol.com\n",

            "For the consolidated numbers for the fourth quarter of FY17 &ndash; the 45 percent growth in revenue was driven by 50 percent and 26 percent growth in refining and petrochemicals respectively.\n",
            "Madhuchanda DeyMoneycontrol ResearchProject commissioning and a substantial addition to Jio subscription were the highlights of the quarterly performance of Reliance Industries, although the broad numbers didn&rsquo;t disappoint either.For the consolidated numbers for the fourth quarter of FY17 &ndash; the 45 percent growth in revenue was driven by 50 percent and 26 percent growth in refining and petrochemicals respectively; whereas organised retail also posted a strong show, growing by 83 percent. Despite a tad subdued margin performance, substantial savings in interest expenses drove the 12 percent growth in profit.Segmental HighlightsFor the key segment of refining - the Gross Refining Margin (GRM) stood at USD 11.5 per barrel against USD 10.8 per barrel in the previous quarter. RIL&rsquo;s GRM outperformed Singapore complex margins by USD 5.1 per barrel. The lower sequential margin was on account of lower gasoline and naphtha cracks.For the petrochemicals segment, the strong topline growth was aided by an increase in prices across all products, which was partially offset by lower volumes. The stable margin performance was supported by product prices.Oil and gas continued with a subdued performance. The decline in revenue was led by lower upstream production and lower domestic gas price realisation. Volumes were lower on account of a slowdown in development activity and natural decline. Consequently, the segment margin was negative.Retail posted a stellar show &ndash; quarterly revenue crossing the 10,000 mark. The increase in turnover was led by growth across all consumption baskets. The margin performance was also stable. Reliance Retail added 63 stores across various store concepts. At the end of the year, it operated 3,616 stores across 702 cities with an area of over 13.5 million square feet.The Growth DriversThe update on Jio was a key takeaway of the earnings. Jio had 108.9 million subscribers on the network. While it isn&rsquo;t revenue accretive at the moment, the key factor to watch out for in Jio is the capacity that&rsquo;s in place. Jio has the world&rsquo;s largest greenfield 4G LTE wireless broadband network, with over 100,000 mobile towers, and will add another 100,000 towers to the network in the coming months.The business hasn&rsquo;t yet started meaningful revenue contribution as it launched with a nominal, one-time enrolment fee of Rs 99. It has been followed up with Jio Dhan Dhana Dhan - at Rs 309 for three months and an unlimited plan at Rs 509 for high data users. However, any future tariff plan will only add to revenue and help achieve break-even of this business.Reliance Industries had embarked upon USD 20 billion core capex which is seeing fruition. One of the major core projects, based on the USD 1.5bn ethane imports from the US - has been commissioned. The highly competitive ethane imports will replace the existing expensive propane feedstock to RIL&rsquo;s crackers, would result in meaningful savings.The company also updated that it has&nbsp;commenced commercial production from its Coal Bed Methane (CBM). The production from RIL&rsquo;s Sohagpur CBM fields will gradually ramp-up in the next 15-18 months making RIL among the largest unconventional natural gas producers in India.RIL also mentioned installation of Para-Xylene, Cracker and downstream projects (MEG, Linear Low density and Low density Polyethylene) as well as Gasification.The traction in telecom revenue and the commissioning of the core projects will be the key drivers of incremental performance going forward. These fundamental drivers alongside a decent valuation of 12.8X FY18 price to earnings lends substantial margin of safety for investors.Disclosure: Reliance Industries, the parent firm of Jio, owns Network 18 that publishes Moneycontrol.com.\n",

The company was promoted by Piramal Group in 1974-75 while the controlling interest was sold to Atul&nbsp;of Lalbhai Group in 1985-86.Amal is engaged in manufacturing and marketing bulk chemicals such as Sulphuric Acid and Oleum and their downstream products such as Sulphur Dioxide and Sulphur Trioxide. The valuation doesn&rsquo;t lend comfort although a correction could make it look interesting.Fag Bearing&nbsp;-- the 51 percent subsidiary of Germany-based Schaeffler Group -- also reported decent earnings on the back of margin improvement. The Indian subsidiary is the second-largest player in the bearings market with 15 percent market share. It is well-diversified across segments and is the market leader in the passenger vehicle segment. The industry is at an inflection point, and for risk-averse investors a stock like Fag offers mid teen earnings growth story.International Travel House, an associate company of ITC Limited and which offers a full bouquet of travel services, also reported a performance worth taking note of. Despite a modest topline growth, significant improvement in operating margin aided a significant surge in profit.The run-up in the past one year has been modest and the valuation looks reasonable seen in the context of the financial performance ofThe Tinplate Company of India (TCIL), a subsidiary of Tata Steel.

            "In an interview to CNBC-TV18's Latha Venkatesh, Sonia Shenoy and Anuj Singhal, Dipan Mehta, Member, BSE &amp;amp; NSE shared his reading and outlook on the market and also gave recommendations on various stocks.\n",
            "In an interview to CNBC-TV18's Latha Venkatesh, Sonia Shenoy and Anuj Singhal, Dipan Mehta, Member, BSE &amp;amp;amp; NSE shared his reading and outlook on the market and also gave recommendations on various stocks.Below is the verbatim transcript of the interview.Anuj: What are your thoughts on Reliance Industries Ltd? That is going to be important stock for the market, do you think it has legs to move from here or do you think it has rallied a lot so there could be some profit taking?A: Reliance just tend to spring a surprise from time to time and this time expectations are high that not only the core business but there would be more input as regards the telecom venture and some visibility of earnings or breakeven over there which is what analysts are looking forward to.So I would be optimistic on the numbers of the company and it is just around the corner so better to wait and watch, hear what the management has to say, see what the guidance is, what the visibility is going forward and any other future plans or at least status of expansion also will be known at that point of time and then make perhaps a trading or an investment call but by and large, on a long-term basis, we are not that optimistic or positive on Reliance and we do feel that Reliance Jio may take a little longer to breakeven and start delivering in terms of return on capital employed and what the street and analysts have factored in to their assumptions and their earnings model.Latha: So it should stabilise at current levels you think, Rs 1,400?A: I will just wait and watch. Let the numbers come out and see what the management has to say and then make a more informed call. Buying just prior to results is not that great strategy from a trading or investment perspective.Latha: Buying after results, HDFC Bank, has more to run?A: HDFC Bank came out with a good set of numbers and although the non-performing assets (NPAs) have been moving up, they are still well under control given the size of the balance sheet and the kind of regular requirements, which are there and it remains a secular consistent performer and I would say that it should be part of every portfolio, at least part of the core holdings. So maybe at these levels or at corrections or in a steady manner investor should look at having a decent exposure to HDFC Bank.Having said that, it is a company which we and our clients have invested as a disclosure and on the whole I think from the earnings release as well as the conference call, it does appear that the kind of edge and the kind of outperformance, which HDFC has versus its peer group in the banking sector still remains pretty much intact and clearly impress the focus of the productivity this time around in terms of number of employees, which got reduced. So many factors going positive for HDFC Bank, qualitative as well as quantitative.For full interview, watch accompanying video...Disclosure: Reliance Industries, the parent company of Reliance Jio, owns Network 18 that publishes Moneycontrol.com.\n",

            "Reliance Industries stock posted negative returns in the past four quarter post results.\n",
            "Kshitij Anand Moneycontrol NewsReliance Industries (RIL), which is scheduled to report its results for the quarter ended March 31 on Monday post market hours, has posted muted performance&nbsp;around the time of its results in the past few quarters but&nbsp;the stock may buck the trend this time.Data show that the stock has posted&nbsp;negative returns in the past four quarters on the day after its results. Over the past eight quarters, the stock goes into the earnings (ahead of or on the day of the earnings) with flattish performance.&amp;quot;This quarter has been an exception where the stock broke an 8-year high on Feb 21 and marched northwards making 52-week high,&rdquo; Rohit Singre, Senior Research Analyst&nbsp; (Equity &ndash; Technical) at Bonanza Portfolio Ltd told Moneycontrol.com.&ldquo;We expect profitability of the company for the current quarter on a consolidated basis to be flat both on sequential as well as on a yearly basis but the commentary on Jio and energy project execution will be the key,&rdquo; he said.This time, RIL's fourth-quarter earnings are expected to be steady to strong as higher petchem profitability may drive sequential operational improvement.Petchem segment should benefit from strong cracker margins, analysts believe. According to the average of estimates of analysts polled by CNBC-TV18, gross refining margin during the quarter is expected to be at USD 10.9 a barrel against USD 10.8 a barrel in the previous quarter.RIL is expected to report 11.8 percent year-on-year (YoY) rise in its net profit to Rs 8,081.5 crore for the quarter ended March 31, compared to Rs 7,227&nbsp;crore reported in the year-ago period, IDFC Capital said in a report.The net sales are likely to rise by 30.9 percent on a YoY basis to Rs 653,723 crore for the quarter ended March 31, compared to Rs 499,570 crore reported in the year-ago period.After the 2008 crash, RIL stock performance was muted for nearly eight successive years.This heavyweight counter broke out of a massive consolidation phase finally on February 21, when the stock moved out of the long multi-year congestion zone to confirm a strong technical breakout.The price development was accompanied by humongous volumes; indicating tremendous buying interests, said experts.The stock has been a standout performer on D-Street so far in the year 2017. It has already rallied nearly 30 percent so far in the year and is close to reclaiming the tag of &lsquo;King of D-Street&rsquo; -- the company with highest market capitalisation on the BSE.&ldquo;There has been no stopping for this stock as the prices hastened beyond the 1400 mark in no time to give 30 percent returns.&nbsp; Hence, as far as direction is concerned, it remains strongly up and the higher degree chart structure looks extremely sturdy,&rdquo; Sameet Chavan, Chief Analyst Technical, and Derivatives, Angel Broking Pvt Ltd told Moneycontrol.com.&ldquo;If we consider past four quarterly results day, the stock prices have been trading with a slightly negative bias post results on three out four occasions. However, we do not expect the history to repeat itself if we consider the recent price and volume activity in the counter,&rdquo; he said.We have collated a list of views on how to trade RIL ahead of Q4 results:Analyst: Mazhar Mohammad, Chief Strategist &ndash; Technical Research &amp;amp;amp; Trading Advisory, Chartviewindia.inSince the last three weeks, this counter is consolidating with an &lsquo;Inside Bar&rsquo; kind of formation on the weekly charts which has a range of Rs 1337 &ndash; 1449. Considering the fact that the scrip has already rallied 30 percent in the last three months, one can safely assume that such a robust move can be in anticipation of good numbers which the market tried factored in.Hence, there will a threat of backlash from the trading community if the expectations are not met on result day.Therefore, we recommend investors who already own this counter to buy out of the money put with a strike price of 1360 to protect the downside risk related to result-day volatility whereas fresh buying can be considered around 1350 levels if scrip corrects.Analyst: Sameet Chavan, Chief Analyst Techical and Derivatives, Angel Broking Pvt Ltd.We expect the stock to continue its northward rally to surpass the all-time high quite soon. Every meaningful dip in this stock is likely to get bought into.Thus, traders/investors who remained on the sidelines in the recent run should pounce on to any decline towards 1350 &ndash; 1300 (if any) post the result announcement. A strong base has now been shifted towards Rs 1,235 and we do not expect the stock to go below this level in the near-term.Foram Parekh, Research analyst (Equity &ndash; Fundamental) at Bonanza Portfolio LtdTalking about past behavior of the stock on result day, we haven&rsquo;t seen much moment historically. We are recommending short strangle strategy can be used to eat the premium. The strategy consists of simultaneously selling one slightly out of the money Call &amp;amp;amp; one slightly out of the money Put.Rohit Srivastava, Fund Manager &ndash; PMS, Sharekhan by BNP Paribas.RIL has been outperforming the market since Nov however it may have completed this move and is due for a correction. This has been one of the best performing periods in years. A pull back to Rs1300 or 1234 in the coming weeks cannot be ruled out, and a move above Rs 1450 may change this opinion.Birendrakumar Singh, AVP &ndash; Technical Research, Systematix shares and stocksReliance gave a multiyear breakout in February 2017. The breakout is out of the 8 years of consolidation that has formed a &ldquo;NeoWave Non Limiting Triangle&rdquo; pattern. The breakout of this 8 years of consolidation is significant, indicates a target of Rs1,735-2,002 and higher.Short term trend is overbought and is likely to consolidate in a range of Rs1,319 and Rs1,448 levels. One should maintain existing long position, in the case of a reaction buy in a range of Rs1,340-1,319 levels.A decisive move above Rs1,448 would indicate further breakout with an immediate target of Rs1,513. Long term target is placed at Rs1,735-2,002, time period 18 months.Disclosure: Reliance Industries owns Network 18, which publishes Moneycontrol.com.

            "Kshitij AnandMoneycontrol NewsRising geopolitical concerns amid mixed bag results from India Inc. capped upside for the markets as Nifty50 closed 0.34 percent lower for the week ended 21 April. The Nifty50 closed marginally lower for third consecutive week suggesting indecisiveness among bulls as well as bears.The coming week is unlikely to be any different as D-Street await results from index heavyweights such as Reliance Industries, Wipro, Kotak Mahindra, Maruti Suzuki, etc. among others.The Indian market has shown a lot of resilience this past week as it refused to go down below its crucial support level of 9,100. The index dipped below 9,100 in intraday trade in 4 out of 5 trading session but managed to close it showing a mark of strength.Most analysts are of the view that as long as the index stays above 9,000 on a closing basis, the trend both from a short to medium-term perspective remains on the upside.On the higher side, the index is likely to touch 9,300-9,340 in the next two or three weeks if 9000 remains intact.We bring you list of 6 factors which are likely to chart the direction of the market this coming week:April F&amp;amp;amp;O Expiry:The market will remain volatile as traders roll over positions in the futures &amp;amp;amp; options (F&amp;amp;amp;O) segment from the near month April 2017 series to May 2017 series. The near month April 2017 derivatives contract expire on Thursday, 27 April 2017.&ldquo;On the data front, open interest in Nifty futures witnessed a secular declining trend throughout the series. The current open interest is almost 20 percent lower compared to open interest seen in the March series at the same point of time,&rdquo; ICICI Securities said in a report.&ldquo;In the options space, the 9000 Put strike remains the highest base. Downsides below these levels are not expected in the Nifty. On the higher side, fresh additions were seen at ATM 9,200 Call strike. Thus, a move above 9,200 is likely to prompt the short covering movement in the index towards settlement,&rdquo; it said.RIL Q4 results:Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) will be in focus as it declares its results for the quarter ended March 31 post market hours on Monday. RILs' fourth-quarter earnings are expected to be steady to strong as higher petchem profitability may drive sequential operational improvement.Petchem segment should benefit from strong cracker margins, analysts believe. According to the average of estimates of analysts polled by CNBC-TV18, gross refining margin during the quarter is expected to be at USD 10.90 a barrel against USD 10.80 a barrel in the previous quarter.Macroeconomic Data:Market participants will also keep an eye on macroeconomic data such as Infrastructure output data, foreign reserve, bank deposit growth as well bank loan growth will be released on April 28, Friday.India's annual infrastructure output growth slowed to 1.0 percent in February, the lowest level in at least 13 months, government data showed on Friday. Overall output grew an annual 3.4 percent in the previous month.French Elections:Security concerns took center stage on Friday after shooting in Paris killed one policeman ahead of the polls. Voters will cast ballots in the first round on Sunday of what has turned into the most unpredictable French election. The two candidates who get the most votes will then face off in a run-off election on May 7.&ldquo;In the coming week, the focus will be on France, where voters are heading to the polls Sunday to choose their next president. France is the second-largest economy in the euro-zone and one of the seven biggest across the world,&rdquo; Vijay Singhania, Founder-Director, Trade Smart Online told Moneycontrol.com.&ldquo;With the run-off of elections scheduled for May 7, it is expected that a new President will be formally confirmed by May 11. France uses the two-round voting system where a leader can be elected this Sunday if they win an outright majority but the polls suggest that this is unlikely, a run-off between the two leading candidates is expected and is scheduled for May 7,&rdquo; he said.Nearly 100 companies to report Q4 results:Nearly 100 companies will report their results for the quarter ended March 31 this coming week which include index heavyweights such as Reliance Industries, Wipro, Kotak Mahindra, Maruti Suzuki, etc. among others.Other companies which will report results for Q4 include names like Indiabulls Housing Finance, UltraTech Cements, Can Fin Homes, IDFC Bank, Indian Bank, Persistent Systems, KPIT Technologies, KSB Pumps, Tata Sponge, Biocon, Indiabulls Real Estate, Syngene International, Tata Elxsi, Ambuja Cements, CEAT, Aditya Birla Money etc. among others.Technical Outlook:As per moving averages, the Nifty50 index is still above its short term moving averages and that is the where it is finding a lot of support around 9,050 levels. The resistance is still around 9,220 &ndash; 9,230 where analysts&rsquo; are seeing a distribution pattern emerging.&ldquo;Going into next week, a range breaks out may further decide the trend though the bullish is bias may continue and any decline towards short term averages may see higher volumes and initial buying set up,&rdquo; Mustafa Nadeem, CEO, Epic Research told Moneycontrol.com.&ldquo;A possible downside can be of marginal 1 percent with support at 9,000 and resistance at 9,300 in the coming week. Below 9,000 we may see a slide to 8,850 &ndash; 8,900,&rdquo; he said.Nadeem further added that as per candlestick reading, indecisiveness is seen on charts with candle patterns showing a small body indicating a range may be seen in the continuation or a breakout may be near.\n",

            "Reliance Industries today said it has begun commercial production of natural gas from coal seams or CBM from its Madhya Pradesh blocks. The company is supplying coal bed methane (CBM) produced from the block SP(West)&ndash;CBM&ndash;2001/1 for commissioning the Shahdol-Phulpur pipeline.&amp;quot;The production from RIL's Sohagpur CBM fields will gradually ramp-up in the next 15-18 months making RIL among the largest unconventional natural gas producers in India,&amp;quot; a company statement said.RIL, however, did not give the current production level. It is targeting 3.5 million standard cubic meters per day of peak output from two adjacent CBM blocks in Sohagpur in Madhya Pradesh. CBM is an environment-friendly natural gas extracted from coal-bed and has become an important source of unconventional gas in many parts of the world.RIL was awarded the licence to explore two adjacent CBM blocks SP(West) and SP(East) with an area of 995 sq.km in the Round 1 of CBM block bidding in 2001.The company said it has drilled more than 200 wells connected to two Gas Gathering Stations in the first phase of development.RIL expects to drill 600-800 wells further and develop associated infrastructure over the next phases of development.Reliance Gas Pipelines Limited (RGPL), a wholly-owned subsidiary of RIL, laid a 302 km Shahdol Phulpur gas pipeline that connects Sohagpur CBM fields from Shahdol to Hazira- Vijaipur-Jagdishpur (HBJ) pipeline network of GAIL at Phulpur.With this new pipeline network these CBM gas fields are now connected with the Indian Gas Grid, it added.Disclosure: Reliance Industries owns Network18, which publishes Moneycontrol.com.\n",

            "From TCS, Coal India to Reliance, a look at what brokerages are talking about these stocks.\n",
            "Tata Consultancy Services (TCS)CLSA has retained its conviction buy rating on the stock with a target of Rs 3,000. The research firm believes that while the company missed revenue marginally due to a drag in BFSI and retail, other verticals such as telecom, manufacturing and life sciences surprised positively. It sees growth accelerating from the first or the second quarter of this fiscal.Analysts at the firm observed that the constant currency margin was intact due to ramp ups in Dilligenta projects and may aid margin in FY18. As such, it sees shaved margins by 60 basis points in FY18 but still expects expansion in FY18-19. It has cut earnings by 2 percent. Furthermore, the capital allocation policy announced by TCS lacks detail, it added.Macquarie has maintained a neutral stance on the stock with a lower target of Rs 2,274. It has lowered FY18-19 estimated earnings per share by 3-5 percent. A pick up in US BFSI, large deal win are the key likely catalysts for the stock.Deutsche Bank reiterated top buy status on the stock with a target at Rs 2,900. It expects the firm to deliver constant currency revenue guidance of 9.4 percent year on year in FY18. Furthermore, it has also cut earnings estimates by 4-5 percent given the margin miss in Q4. It expect the company to deliver EPS Of Rs 145.7 in FY18 &amp;amp;amp; earnings CAGR of 12% in FY18-20JPMorgan has a neutral call on the stock with a target of Rs 2,450. The research firm observed that FY17&rsquo;s robustly free cash flow/PAT conversion ratio implies 75-80 percent PAT paid out as dividends.Bank of America Merrill Lynch has retained an underperform rating on the stock with a target price of Rs 2,130. It believes that TCS&rsquo; Q4 revenue growth and EBIT margin were below consensus and expectations. It expects a decline in EBIT margin as rupee appreciation is also weighing on it.Citi has a sell call on the stock with a target price of Rs 2,140 from Rs 2,195. The company&rsquo;s Q4 results are largely in line with estimates and the margin band of 26-28 percent looks difficult considering FY17 miss. The lower than consensus expectation remains unchanged, it added. Furthermore, valuation at over 17 times FY18e is difficult to justify given the slowing growth.IDFC securities has reiterated its neutral rating on the stock with a cut in target price to Rs 2,325. The soft performance in Q4 is largely on account of weaker BFSI and retail growth. It believes that the drag from larger vertical would restrict revenue growth to 6 percent. Appreciation in rupee and investment to mitigate visa risk will erode earnings further, it added.The brokerage house was factoring in mid-single digit earnings CAGR over FY17-19The management&rsquo;s outlook for BFSI is stronger for FY18, but optimism is not translated in deal wins, it added. Furthermore, it is factoring in slight erosion in operating margin, but sees downside risk if the rupee held on to its level.Jefferies has maintained its buy call on the stock with a reduced target to Rs 2,590. It projected dollar revenue growth of 8.7/10 percent in FY18/19 with margin below 26-28 percent range. A more constructive outlook for FY18 and robust execution are key positives.ICICI Securities retained add call on the stock due to the management commentary on strong pipeline and deal momentum. The target price for the stock is at Rs 2,415. It expects growth at higher end of peer averages on an organic basis in FY18. But it also sees difficulty in sustaining margin in FY18 even at lower end of targeted range.Goldman Sachs has maintained its neutral rating with a cut in target price to Rs 2,092. The earnings in Q4 were below expectations and BFSI growth remained elusive, the research firm observed. A pick up in BFSI and strong digital practice should lead to 8.3 percent CC growth in FY18.Coal IndiaCiti has a buy call on the stock with a cut in target price to Rs 325 from Rs 375. It sees a fair bit of negative news flow to be priced in.VST IndustriesICICI Securities has downgraded the stock to add from buy, but increased target to Rs 3,249 from Rs 2,713. The brokerage remains positive but the 40 percent rally in the past four months is compelling it to downgrade the stock.Reliance IndustriesJPMorgan has a neutral call on the stock with a target of Rs 1,240. The brokerage house expects another strong quarter, driven by a strong refining margin. It expects standalone PAT at RS 8,180 crore and EBITDA should be up 6 percent quarter on quarter. Furthermore, on Jio, it maintained the view that it would turn profit positive only in 2021.(Disclosure: Reliance Industries owns Network 18 that publishes Moneycontrol.com.)\n",

The stock has managed to hold the immediate support of Rs 1,360-1,355 zone and negated its formation of lower highs, lower lows on the daily chart. So, overall major trend of the stock is positive and the recent decline is giving a fresh opportunity to buy. So, recommending to go long with a stop loss of Rs 1,365 for the upside target of Rs 1,440. We have seen Put writing and Call unwinding in most of the strikes which also supports our positive look.&amp;quot;&amp;quot;Second trade is buy on Indiabulls Housing Finance. We have a positive view on most of the non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) like Dewan Housing Finance (DHFL) and&nbsp;LIC Housing Finance. Here we are recommending to be positive with Indiabulls Housing Finance. Recently, it has taken support at its 50 percent retracement and negated its immediate negative trend. Overall major trend of the counter is positive and recent consolidation has given the fresh buying opportunity. If you are seeing short covering activities, open interest fell down by around 3-4 percent. So, recommending to go long with a stop loss of Rs 944 for the upside target of Rs 1,020,&amp;quot; he said.&amp;quot;The last trade is buy on GAIL India. Positive sector outlook and the fresh momentum in the counter suggest that the sell can extend to Rs 410.

            "\n",
            "Reliance Industries and other producers of coal bed methane have been granted pricing and marketing independence as well as permission to sell fuel to affiliates after the formal policy notification.Through the April 13 notification, the oil ministry said a coal bed methane (CBM) producer has to call for open bids for sale of coal gas and seek price quotes to discover the market price.The producer will have to issue advertisement in national dailies and run a competitive bidding to arrive at the arm's-length sale price, it said.The process prescribed is the same as the one Reliance Industries had run in 2012 to discover a price for CBM gas it is to produce in Madhya Pradesh. It had sought bids for 3.5 million standard cubic metres per day of coal gas from its Sohagpur CBM block in Madhya Pradesh at a benchmarked rate at 12.67 per cent of JCC, or Japan Customs-Cleared Crude, plus USD 0.26 per million British thermal unit. The formula was the same at which Petronet LNG, a joint venture of public sector oil companies, whose chairman is the oil secretary, used to buy long-term liquefied natural gas (LNG) from Qatar.At USD 100 per barrel oil price prevalent that year, CBM from RIL's Madhya Pradesh block was to cost USD 12.93 per mmBtu. At USD 55 a barrel rate currently, it would cost USD 7.2. That formula was, however, rejected by the ministry even though 59 valid bids seeking about 70 mmscmd of gas were received in the open tender.&amp;quot;In the event of market-discovered price being less than the price notified by the Petroleum Planning Analysis Cell (PPAC) under the New Domestic Natural Gas Pricing Guidelines, 2014, the royalty and production level payment (PLP) shall be paid on the basis of the latter,&amp;quot; the CBM pricing policy notified last week said. The PPAC notified price of gas for April 1 to September 30 at USD 2.48 per mmBtu and the same for difficult areas is USD 5.56 per mmBtu, lower than the rate in RIL formula.&amp;quot;Sale of CBM to any affiliate of the contractor is permitted, in the event the contractor cannot identify any buyer following the procedure (of open bidding),&amp;quot; the policy said, adding that the reasons for sale to affiliates will have to be notified to the Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH).The policy is expected to incentivise the CBM operation in the country to boost gas production.Of the 33 CBM-bearing blocks awarded so far in four auction rounds and on a nomination basis, gas is being produced from only four.The four CBM blocks in production have a combined output of 1.17 million standard cubic metres per day. As many as 18 blocks have either been relinquished or are in the process as operators found that it did not make economic sense to produce gas at the prevailing rates.According to the DGH, India has the fifth largest proven coal reserves in the world and holds significant prospects for exploration and exploitation of CBM. The estimated CBM resources in the country are about 92 trillion cubic feet.The 33 CBM blocks awarded so far hold a total of 62.4 tcf of the estimated resources, of which so far, 9.9 tcf has been established as Gas in Place (GIP).The pricing freedom will help quickly ramp up CBM gas production to targeted 5.77 mmscmd within a year, officials said.(Disclosure: RIL, which owns Reliance Jio, also owns Network18 and&nbsp;moneycontrol.com).\n",

The way the market is moving higher, large stocks turning around, it was clear yesterday&rsquo;s correction was because of Reliance Industries and Infosys. Once both these stocks turn, I would not be surprised if the market closes at the highs of the day and very close to previous highs because this short covering will only increase. So, chances are banks will outperform and Bank Nifty will soon see 21,700-21,750.&amp;quot;&amp;quot;Today, particularly PSUs are doing very well. So, Dredging Corporation is a buy with a stop loss of Rs 685 and target of Rs 710. Engineers India (EIL) is a buy with a stop loss of Rs 148 and target of Rs 160. India Cements is a buy with a stop loss of Rs 160 and target of Rs 172,&amp;quot; he said.&amp;quot;Cement is not the top performer in this market. The top performer remains NBFCs and PSUs. So, ACC and Ambuja Cements I don&rsquo;t think will really shoot the moon with their movement. India Cements generally tends to perform because it is part of the midcap group which is outperforming in general. So, overall, UltraTech Cement and India Cements are outperforming in the market. I think ACC and Ambuja Cements remain laggards.&amp;quot;&amp;quot;ITC has been in a strong uptrend. It goes into bit of a huddle off and on, but overall I think targets of Rs 315-320 seem likely in the weeks to come.&amp;quot;Disclosure: Reliance Industries owns Network 18 that publishes Moneycontrol.com.\n",

            "Manish Sonthalia, Head - Equities, PMS at Motilal Oswal AMC told CNBC-TV18, &amp;quot;The concerned point on Reliance Industries was the telecom business. When you had that specific number come through &ndash; 72 million subscribers &ndash; that was a comforting factor because people were betting on 10 crore subscribers to achieve a breakeven and if you have hit 70 million subscribers, there is some ray of hope from this side of business. Rest of the businesses were doing extremely well. So, that is the silver lining on Reliance and stock price has actually rallied.&amp;quot;&amp;quot;In the case of Larsen &amp;amp;amp; Toubro, I think now there is greater visibility that for the next 3-4 years. You should be seeing a 15 percent CAGR and that sort of a thing is not there is the price. So, that is what the markets are looking into. We own L&amp;amp;amp;T in one of our portfolios. So, I am able to talk specifically more about this. I see a 15 percent CAGR growth in profits in L&amp;amp;amp;T between now and the next 3-4 years. So, I think the valuations are perfectly comfortable. In general case also large caps have more value than midcaps and smallcaps in anycase, so that is the main reason why L&amp;amp;amp;T is rallying. I think there is even more upside from these levels in case of Larsen,&amp;quot; he said.\n",

            "In an interview to CNBC-TV18&rsquo;s Latha Venkatesh, Sonia Shenoy, and Anuj Singhal, Deven Choksey of KRChoksey Investment Managers shared his readings and outlook on market and specific stocks.\n",
            "In an interview to CNBC-TV18&rsquo;s Latha Venkatesh, Sonia Shenoy, and Anuj Singhal, Deven Choksey of KRChoksey Investment Managers shared his readings and outlook on market and specific stocks.Below is the verbatim transcript of the interview.Anuj: The stock that is leading the market is Reliance Industries. You track it of course, but do you think the risk reward is still favorable or would you advise profit taking here?A: I think Reliance should be seen as an opportunity for next two to three years from now onwards. Probably if the market has risen I think for last three to four months, maybe I think of around 3-40 percent rally has come in the stock price, I would think that it is largely attributed to the capacity that they have expanded in their core businesses both in petrochemical polymer as well as into refining business.So, on one side, they are going to have the volume led growth coming in because of this expansion in capacity, and other side they would have the advantage in the refining margin per se. So, that is basically attributed to the current rally in the price. I would still think that Reliance Jio and Reliance Retail, both these units within the company, I think they hold significant amount of some of the part valuation; maybe in my viewpoint somewhere around Rs 800 per share kind of a valuation between two of them is still not fully reflected into the price.So, if the price improves to that level, maybe one could say that yes they are now finding its value into the price of Reliance. Otherwise, I would think that upside is still there. Maybe two years down the line I think we should be seeing the stock giving a handsome return from current price level itself.Sonia: The other stocks that have been hitting new highs from the heavyweights are names like Larsen and Toubro (L&amp;amp;amp;T), State Bank of India (SBI), etc. What else from the heavyweights do you like now?A: In fact I think these two stocks which you mentioned, between the two of them, definitely SBI looks more convincing at this point of time. Given the kind of a merger that they have done, given the size of the balance sheet that they are having now with the merged units coming up, and also the fact that the non-performing assets (NPAs) is gradually coming down. That is giving me larger amount of comfort.On the contrary, I am waiting for the NPA finding its monetisation through the securitised receipt kind of an instrument which will come up eventually in the market now that the finance bill is passed. I would think that these are some of the positives for banks like SBI and fortunately the stock is available at valuation which has definitely corrected significantly.So, to an extent, I would think that the margin of safety is remaining higher in this particular stock. Maybe I think one could have a 25-30 percent kind of an upside target over next 15-18 months&rsquo; time in this particular stock.Sonia: A quick word on Avenue Supermarts (D-Mart), everyone says it looks quite expensive at Rs 660, but for somebody who is perhaps still not invested in it, would you advise it or stay away?A: The fact is that I think the stock is having relatively less amount of liquidity post listing. I think that is possibly driving the premium valuation. Leave that aside for a while, I think the more important aspect is the fundamentals of the business. The fundamentals of the business basically I think is suggesting that the company is easily expected to grow between 25-30 percent on an organic basis at least I think for next three years as far as the visibility goes.Given that kind of situation, given the kind of supply chain cost benefit that they are enjoying in the product vertical particularly in the food grains, I guess I think the company could possibly register reasonably smart move going forward as far as the profit outlook is concerned. With the interest cost coming down, I think it is going to be all the more beneficial for the company to register better profits.So, given that kind of a scenario, I am not having doubt in my mind about the growth in the profit that the company could register.However, the question remains on the premium valuation. In my viewpoint, some amount of time correction is justified in this particular stock and then probably I think an investor could think of buying the stock with a view of at least two years from now.For full interview, watch accompanying video.\n",

It may also help the government avoid any political backlash as incremental price changes may go mostly unnoticed.Daily revision of fuel rates is common in various advanced markets. In India, the current trend is to change fuel rates every fortnight.According to one of the state-run oil firms, there have been talks of a daily price change for very long, but the technology has only now been made available to them.Earlier, revision of fuel prices would mean companies making phone calls or sending out faxes, but now with various digital means, oil companies can centrally changes prices from one location of all petrol pumps.&amp;quot;Daily price revision is about introducing international standards in the Indian fuel retail market. It helps both customers as well as dealers in managing their purchases,&amp;quot; an executive of an oil firm told the ET.India lifted control of petrol prices in 2014 and diesel in 2010, leaving them to be governed by market prices.The government has also encouraging private participation in the sector, with Reliance Industries, Essar&nbsp;Oil and Shell all having plans to ramp up their currently-small presence in the Indian fuel retail market.Between them, Indian Oil, BPCL and HPCL control 95 percent of the market.\n",

            "Moody's calculation shows that Jio will be able to generate revenue of about Rs 213 billion (Rs 21,300 crore) for the current financial year, assuming all 72 million users pay Rs 303 per 28 days between July 2017 and March 2018.\n",
            "Newcomer Jio's 72 million paid customers are &amp;quot;credit positive&amp;quot; for parent Reliance Industries as subscriber enrolment reduces cash flow uncertainty of the telecom business, Moody's Investors Service said today.Moody's calculation shows that Jio will be able to generate revenue of about Rs 213 billion (Rs 21,300 crore) for the current financial year, assuming all 72 million users pay Rs 303 per 28 days between July 2017 and March 2018.On the enrolment of paid subscribers, Moody's Investors Service said, &amp;quot;This is credit positive as the subscriber enrolment reduces cash flow uncertainty of the telecom business, on which RIL has spent over Rs 1.7 trillion (Rs 1,70,000 crore) over the last six years.&amp;quot;Jio, in February, said it has enrolled 100 million users for its free services that was slated to end on March 31. The company had also announced that it would start charging for services from April 1 and introduced Jio-Prime membership, a discounted set of price plans to incentivise non-paying subscribers to subscribe to paid services.It has now extended by a fortnight the deadline for enrolment to its Jio-Prime plan, and as per its last update has 72 million paid customers. Also, it has announced that all Prime members who subscribe to higher value plans (Rs 303 and above) will enjoy complimentary services for three months and that subscribers will only be charged for services from July.&amp;quot;... there was uncertainty about the success rate of transitioning non-paying subscribers to paid plans, but that uncertainty has now reduced to a large extent,&amp;quot; the statement by Moody's said.It further said a significant portion of the 72 million subscribers are expected to opt for Rs 303 plan, given that it is the minimum plan that gives complimentary services for three months.&amp;quot;However, as the price plan does not require the subscriber to commit beyond the 28 days, they are free to switch at any time after that,&amp;quot; it said, adding that Prime membership will therefore have to continue to be competitive and maintain service quality to retain customers.The company may have to revisit its price plans beyond April 15 to attract and retain subscribers who do not sign up for the Prime offering, it noted.Even if Jio were to generate about Rs 200 billion (Rs 20,000 crore) in revenue, it will not be sufficient to generate free cash flows as the company's spending on capex will be significantly higher than its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA), Moody's said.Hence, despite a large paying subscriber base, Moody's said, &amp;quot;We continue to expect that Jio will remain a drag on RIL's cash flows for at least the next 2-3 years.&amp;quot;Jio's aggressive stance will ensure a heightened state of competition in the sector for the foreseeable future, it added.Disclosure: Reliance Jio is a part of Reliance Industries that&nbsp; owns Network 18 Media &amp;amp;amp; moneycontrol.com\n",

It is a stock you could actually carry forward, even if you are a short term trader. It is just willing to breakout of a nice attractive trading range.&amp;quot;&nbsp;&amp;quot;HDFC which had a slight setback, a mild correction is now renewing itself after that correction and is a buying opportunity. Think of these as intraday trades and if you want to carry them, if the markets are closing fairly strong, you might like to carry longs but don&rsquo;t carry the shorts.&amp;quot;&nbsp;&amp;quot;Infibeam&rsquo;s price chart is not enough and it had a dramatic rally also. It is not just the decline. So, it is very confusing. When there is confusion, I say completely step aside and avoid the stock.&amp;quot;&nbsp;&amp;quot;Voltas is a buy. Every dip and I would consider Friday to be a dip that leads us to a buying opportunity. The only reason we have to be a little circumspect is because of that holiday tomorrow. However, Voltas is in a strong uptrend, dips and consolidation should be used to go long.&amp;quot;Disclosure: Reliance Industries owns Network 18 that publishes Moneycontrol.com.\n",

            "In an interview to CNBC-TV18&rsquo;s Latha Venkatesh, Anuj Singhal, and Sonia Shenoy, Sandeep Shenoy of Pioneer Investcorp shared his readings and outlook on market and specific stocks.Below is the verbatim transcript of the interview.Sonia: The stock that could be on the rise today is Reliance Industries because of the announcement that they made of 72 million subscribers that have availed the Jio Prime Membership. This stock has been on a tear, but do you see a lot more upside from the current level?A: It is probably one of the largest capex ever undertaken in India, maybe in the entire Asia-Pacific region. So, we have to just wait and see how it pans out on the earnings front. 72 million while it looks big for an industry upstart entrant, it may not sound that much of a music for somebody trying to extrapolate into earnings stream.So, I guess we have to wait and watch for some time. However, nonetheless 72 million is decent percentage of Indian population and that is about it.Latha: Are you positive on the stock itself, I mean it has seen a fairly decent run up, after all the index is looking for support from various sectors, will Reliance be one of them?A: I would not want to pass a specific comment on any stock, but, yes, when a largecap stock generally morphs, of this size, something undertakes such a huge morphing of its entire business model, I guess it is just generally a long-term pain and long-term pain seems to be drawing to an end for this company.So, yes, you could expect something, maybe a light at the end of the tunnel. As I mentioned, it is probably one of the largest capex ever undertaken and if this calculated gamble works out, you could be in for good times.Sonia: The other thing that stands out in the data over the weekend is the way the tractor sales have done really well whether it is for Mahindra and Mahindra (M&amp;amp;amp;M) or even for a company like Escorts that just announced its numbers. These stocks have seen a goodish bit of an up move, but do you still see a lot of value in this space?A: I think tractor sales, I don&rsquo;t know I may be in minority, but we may have jumped the guns out there because generally it has to be a post-harvest phenomena and we are seeing it in a pre-monsoon phenomena which may not be justifiable at the current levels. So, I guess we may have, the entire market may have jumped -- I am not saying the stock market, but the tractor market may have jumped the gun.They may have been some pre-emptive buying out there, but for stock market, yes, it may be sensible or prudent to take some money off the table at the current level because I think the monsoon and the portents which are coming, may not be that good. So you could see some corrections which could turn out into decent buying opportunities for you in the next three to four months.For full interview, watch accompanying video.Disclosure: Reliance Industries, the parent company of Reliance Jio, owns Network 18 that publishes Moneycontrol.com.\n",

            "United Spirits on the back of Supreme Court&rsquo;s decision to ban alcohol on highways and Reliance Industries after extending its Jio Prime membership are on analysts&rsquo; radar today\n",
            "United SpiritsJefferies has reiterated an underperform rating on the stock with a lowered target price of Rs 1,812 from Rs 1,900. The research firm sees a disruption due to the Supreme Court order that banned liquor shops on highways. Even if states choose to circumvent the ban, the company may still see demand destruction, it added. The ban will now shift demand to shops further away from highways.The key risk to the stock could be monetization of non-core assets and a further buyback by Diageo.On the financials front, analysts at the firm have cut FY19 earnings per share estimates by 6.5 percent and value the stock using 12-month forward PE target multiple of 50 times.CLSA has recommended a sell call with a reduced target price to Rs 1,600 from Rs 2,100 as profitability could be long going ahead. It has cut FY17-19 EPS by 17-28 percent, but also expects states to support the industry during the transition which will still take time. The key upside risk to the stock could be the hope of a tender offer from Diageo.Morgan Stanley is overweight on United Spirits with a target price of Rs 2,900. It foresees 42 percent of the country&rsquo;s liquor sales facing dislocation due to the ban. Furthermore, it sees a near-term impact on the firm&rsquo;s volumes as the business gets aligned to the new rules.IIFL has an add rating on the stock with a target price of Rs 2,250. The brokerage house sees muted growth to FY18 on the back of the apex court&rsquo;s verdict as well as implementation of GST. The ban will weigh on the company&rsquo;s Q4 alcohol sales as well.Further, demonetisation impact will continue to be visible, but at a lower level than Q3. It sees the firm&rsquo;s earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation growing 15 percent and hence sees 14 percent decline in EPS in Q4.Kotak Institutional Equities expects the SC verdict&rsquo;s impact to be material but transitionary in nature till shops relocate. It sees the decision hitting liquor firms as 35-40 percent liquor outlets are located along the highways. This relocation will drive de-stocking in the near term which can impact Q1 volume.Reliance IndustriesJPMorgan is neutral on the stock with a target of Rs 1,240. The research firm sees Reliance&rsquo;s decision to extend Jio Prime deadline as a step to add more subscribers and believes that the firm&rsquo;s telecom journey has just begun. The sign-ups are a positive, but extension and more freebies are puzzling, it says.Furthermore, it sees net debt to continue to rise and the final capex figure is yet to be seen. Jio would need revenues of USD 400-500 billion to be PBT positive and forecasts EBITDA of USD 221 billion in FY21 and USD 287 billion in FY22. The stock also implies a telecom EBITDA of over USD 4.7 billion.Disclaimer: Reliance Jio is a part of Reliance Industries that owns Network 18 Media &amp;amp;amp; moneycontrol.com\n",

            "All those who enrol before April 15 and recharge for plans of Rs 303 and more will get three months of complimentary service i.e. the company will not charge you anything till July 1, 2017 and one can continue availing benefits of its existing plan.\n",
            "Reliance Jio has extended the deadline to enrol for its Jio Prime plan till April 15, 2017. The move comes as a relief to millions of Jio customers who can enrol themselves for the service by paying a one-time fee of Rs 99 and avail of a host of benefits.Along with the extension of the deadline, Jio continued with its streak of throwing surprises when it unveiled its latest offer known as &lsquo;Summer Surprise&rsquo;. Mukesh Ambani, Chairman of Reliance Industries', promises this to be just the first of many surprises lined up for Jio Prime members.Ambani in his statement said more than 72 million Jio customers have signed up for Jio Prime so far and the number is only supposed to go up further.Here&rsquo;s a brief of what the plans are and how Prime members stand to benefit.Extension of enrolment for Prime:Jio&rsquo;s free service period is coming to an end. Jio Users as customers can enrol for Jio Prime offer by paying just Rs 99 and opting for a plan of Rs 303 or above.&lsquo;Summer Surprise&rsquo; offerAll those who enrol before April 15 and recharge for plans of Rs 303 and more will get three months of complimentary service i.e. the company will not charge you anything till July 1, 2017 and one can continue availing benefits of its existing plan.For example, if a user recharges with Rs 99 (enrolment into Jio Prime) and then recharges worth Rs 303, before April 15 he can avail 1GB data per day along with unlimited free calling services and SMS service.Now instead of Rs 303, if somebody recharges worth Rs 499 he will receive 2GB data every day for free till July 1, 2017.What will happen if you don&rsquo;t enrol for Prime by April 15?If one fails to recharge by April 15, all the free services from Jio will come to an end. Furthermore, Jio Prime members enjoy almost double data benefits when compared to non-Jio Prime members.According to Reliance, users who do not recharge by April 15 will experience degradation and/or discontinuation of services.What to do if the Rs 303-data plan with 1 GB daily FUP is not enough?If 1GB free data daily on 4G speeds is not good enough you can opt for the Rs 499 Jio Prime plan which offers a daily FUP on 4G speeds of 2GB for 28 days. To get rid of the FUP altogether, users can opt for the Rs 999 Jio Prime Plan, which offers 60GB 4G data with 60 days validity without any FUP.There are other plans for Rs 1,999, Rs 4,999 and Rs 9,999 with 90 days, 180 days and 360 days validity and 125GB, 350GB, and 750GB data respectively without any FUP.In case, you are using a Jio Prime plan without FUP and run out of data midway, you can always opt for booster packs ranging between Rs 11 and Rs 301 with 0.1GB to 10GB data.Disclosure: Reliance Industries, which owns Reliance Jio, also owns Network18, which publishes Moneycontrol.com.\n",

            "Moneycontrol NewsReliance Industries Chairman Mukesh Ambani on Friday announced the continuation of its free services for three more months, if Jio Prime members recharge their accounts for the first month with Rs 303 or more. The telecom company also extended its Jio Prime subscription enrollment till April 15.Dubbing it as Jio's Summer Surprise to users who have agreed to pay for its 4G services, the company extended&nbsp;the offer as a token of appreciation to the 72 million subscribers who signed up for its Prime membership service.This is the largest transition ever from a free service to a paid one, the company said explaining the reason for extending the Jio Prime membership offer till April 15.All subscribers who recharge with Rs 303 in April will get services free till July, Ambani announced on Friday.In a letter to customers, Ambani said: &amp;quot;I am committed to walking the extra mile for my Jio family members. We have heard your voice and are extending this deadline for purchasing Jio's Rs 303 and other plans till April 15. This extension will provide the necessary breathing room for users to avoid service disruption during transition from free to paid services.&rdquo;Jio is the only operator to offer 1 GB of 4G data to subscribers with no hidden clauses unlike many other operators who are giving it for a limited period of 3 months to post-paid customers.Users who do not pay for Jio's services will see degradation and discontinuation of services from April 15. In February, Jio had announced that it would offer data at special prices to its 100 million subscribers if they paid Rs 99 to become Jio Prime members.Reliance Jio announced on Friday that 72 million subscribers on its network had signed up for the Prime Membership.&nbsp;Besides, Jio now has the largest 4G subscriber base in the country with more 4G subscribers than incumbents such as Bharti Airtel, Idea Cellular and Vodafone India.If subscribers pay Rs 303 per month for an year, the company would have collected Rs 720 crore in fees and will clock in revenues of Rs 24,000 crore in FY18, analysts said. Shares of Reliance Industries ended the day at Rs 1,319, the highest since 2008.In a related development, the Advertising Standards Council on Friday asked Airtel to remove or modify its advertisements that claim it is the fastest network operator in India. The fast-track committee on Friday ruled in favour of Jio stating that the ads were misleading. According to reports, Airtel plans to contest the ruling of the ASCI and plans to file an appeal.Disclosure: Reliance Industries, which owns Reliance Jio, also owns Network18, which publishes Moneycontrol.com.\n",

            "A three-member arbitration panel has started hearing validity of the government's demand of USD 1.55 billion as compensation from Reliance Industries for &amp;quot;unfairly&amp;quot; producing ONGC's gas.\n",
            "A three-member arbitration panel has started hearing validity of the government's demand of USD 1.55 billion as compensation from Reliance Industries for &amp;quot;unfairly&amp;quot; producing ONGC's gas.The panel, headed by Singapore-based arbitrator Prof Lawrence Boo, had its first hearing on March 3 where the timetable was drawn, sources privy to the development said. RIL will first file its statement of claim, followed by a statement of defence by the government.This will be followed by rejoinders, counter-rejoinders and oral hearing, sources said, adding that the panel plans to wind up the hearing in a year. The central government has named former Supreme Court judge GS Singhvi as its nominee on the three-member arbitration panel while RIL and its partners BP Plc of the UK and Canada's Niko Resources have named former UK High Court Judge Bernard Eder to the panel. RIL-BP-Niko had slapped an arbitration notice on November 11 last year.This was against the oil ministry's November 3, 2016 notice to RIL, Niko and UK's BP seeking USD 1.47 billion for producing about 338.332 million British thermal units of gas in the seven years ended March 31, 2016 that had seeped or migrated from the Oil and Natural Gas Corporation's (ONGC) blocks into their adjoining KG-D6 in the Bay of Bengal.After deducting USD 71.71 million royalty paid on the gas produced and adding an interest at the rate of Libor plus 2 per cent, totalling USD 149.86 million, a total demand of USD 1.55 billion was made on RIL, BP and Niko. RIL is the operator of the KG-D6 block with 60 per cent interest while BP holds 30 per cent. The remaining 10 per cent is with Niko Resources.The government's compensation claim flowed from the report of the Justice (retd) A P Shah Committee. The Shah panel, in its August 28, 2016, report, concluded that there has been &amp;quot;unjust enrichment&amp;quot; to the contractor of the block KG-DWN-98/3 (KG-D6) due to production of the migrated gas from ONGC's blocks KG-DWN-98/2 and Godavari PML.The government, sources said, accepted the recommendations of the committee and consequently, decided to claim restitution from RIL-BP-Niko for &amp;quot;the unjust benefit received and unfairly retained&amp;quot;. So, a notice was sent, they said, adding that the government is also pressing RIL to pay USD 174.9 million of additional profit petroleum after certain costs were disallowed because of KG-D6 output being lower than the target.The cost recovery issue is being arbitrated separately. Originally, ONGC had sued RIL for producing gas that had migrated from its blocks KG-DWN-98/2 (KG-D5) and Godavari PML in the KG basin to adjoining KG-D6 block of RIL. Under direction of the Delhi High Court, the government had appointed a one-man committee under retired Justice A P Shah to go into the issue. Shah, however, said the compensation should go to the government as it is the owner of all unproduced natural resources.Disclosure: Reliance Industries owns Network 18, which publishes Moneycontrol\n",

When asked whether he sees a reverse brain-drain, he quipped &amp;quot;without doubt&amp;quot;.&amp;quot;By whatever fate they are brought back to this country, they can help improve the lives of 1.3 billion citizens and put together a new developmental model...there cannot be a better blessing in disguise than that,&amp;quot; Ambani told the India Today Conclave.He said of late RIL is getting many Indians who have held leadership roles in other countries in the past. RIL is getting at least two-three such talent every month, he said. &amp;quot;We have more talent knocking at our doors because at the end of the day, 'har ek ka dil hain Hindustani'.

Our IT industry can focus on solving the problems right here, which is a huge market,&amp;quot; he had said in a stance which was seen as contrary to the prevailing atmosphere of paranoia and fear about the future.Ambani today said we are fortunate to be an open market with a leader who understands technology. He recalled how Prime Minister Narendra Modi spent an entire dinner meeting with the last American president Barack Obama discussing how technology could resolve many of the problems the world is seeped in.The recent note-ban exercise will lead to greater proliferation of digitalisation and take the country from a cash-based economy to a &amp;quot;cash optimal&amp;quot; one, he said.

            "In an interview to CNBC-TV18, Deven Choksey, MD of KRChoksey Investment Managers shared his readings and outlook on specific stocks and sectors.Below is the verbatim transcript of Deven Choksey's interview to Latha Venkatesh, Sonia Shenoy &amp;amp;amp; Anuj Singhal.Latha: The goods and services tax (GST) council has finished its meet and we have a reasonable promise that final tax along with the cess on cigarettes and on luxury cars will not be more than what the consumers are currently paying. Will you go by that or is there a worry that because there is an enabling provision at some later date, the taxes could be more?A: As it comes out and as we call it as a sin tax, it is capped at 15 percent for the time being which according to me could be a good amount of breather/steady environment provider at this point of time for most of the companies without disrupting the existing set of the business etc, so that could be seen in the near future, at least some amount of stability factor as far as this particular tax goes and its impact on different companies and the consumers thereon.However, from long-term perspective I do not know whether the enabling provision would be exercising the near future or maybe it would take longer time for exercising the rates which are more than the capped rates of around 15 percent at this point of time.Latha: So you buy ITC?A: ITC looks promising for sure, leave aside this particular move, the stock looks promising because of all the business verticals in which they are operating, each of them are showing distinct signs of growth and promises for better profit performance going forward. So certainly ITC remains a good pick within the fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) space.Anuj: How would you approach Reliance Industries at current levels?A: Fundamentally the stock remains quite comfortable having seen the expansion in the capacity in the petrochemical polymer segment, having seen the expansion in the capacity in the refining segment and the output probably would start contributing in FY17-18 along with lower cost of feed stock. The core business itself is expected to produce performance which is almost going to be 1/3rd more than what the company has been producing at this point of time, so maybe in 12-15 months time you should be seeing the full capacity of expanded volumes which would come into play from the core business itself.However, the Jio business is having a valuation close to Rs 550-600 on sum-of-the-parts valuation basis which could reflect another Rs 400-500 jump into the stock price going forward. The retail business given the D-Mart's valuation I would assume and start giving the valuation perspective into Reliance, its combined stock from sum-of-the-parts perspective. So overall I am comfortable. The stock remains potential target price for Rs 1,600-1,800 levels going forward.(Disclosure: Network 18, which publishes moneycontrol.com, is a part of the Reliance Group.)For entire interview, watch accompanying video.\n",

It &amp;quot;will generate economic activities which in turn will be beneficial for creating more employment opportunities in CBM operations and related activities,&amp;quot; it added.Of the 33 CBM bearing blocks awarded so far in four auction rounds and on a nomination basis, gas is being produced from only four.The move will benefit Reliance which has two blocks in Madhya Pradesh that are in the process of starting production.ONGC and Essar Oil too will benefit from the new policy as it will help them put their acreage into production quickly.The four CBM blocks in production have a combined output of 1.17 million standard cubic metres per day. As many as 18 blocks have either been relinquished or are in the process as operators found that it did not make economic sense to produce gas at the prevailing rates.Most of the natural gas produced in the country is priced at average of rates prevailing in gas surplus nations like the US, Russia and Canada. The current price comes to USD 2.5 per million British thermal unit, a rate considered unviable by many operators.According to the Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH), India has the 5th largest proven coal reserves in the world and holds significant prospects for exploration and exploitation of CBM. The estimated CBM resources in the country are about 92 trillion cubic feet.The 33 CBM blocks awarded so far hold a total of 62.4 Tcf of the estimated CBM resource, of which, so far, 9.9 Tcf has been established as Gas in Place (GIP).The sources said the CBM gas pricing policy proposed to the Cabinet is in line with the recently unveiled regime governing small and marginal oil and natural gas blocks.The government had recently auctioned small and marginal discovered oil and gas fields by promising investors complete pricing, marketing and production freedom under a revenue sharing contract agreement.Pricing freedom would help quickly ramp up CBM gas production to targeted 5.77 mmscmd within a year, they said.Disclosure: Reliance Industries owns Network18 media and Moneycontrol.com.\n",

            "State-owned insurer New India Assurance has bagged a Rs 500-crore combined cover from Reliance Industries for its onshore and offshore assets for the next financial year, according to industry sources.At Rs 500 crore, this is the single largest insurance cover taken by any corporate in the country so far.According to the people aware of the development, the premium fixed for the mega combined insurance cover, which came into force from February 1, is Rs 500 crore with a sum assured of over Rs 2.5 trillion.Such a policy is not new as more than 30 corporates have been availing of such covers since 2000. But it is for the first time that New India is offering a combined cover to both RIL's onshore and offshore assets.RIL and New India Assurance could not be reached for comments.The cover includes RIL's two 60 mt refineries in Jamnagar and its offshore assets in the Krishna-Godavari Basin, industry sources told PTI.The combined mega policy provided to Reliance projects have been reinsured by around 90 per cent, the sources added.It is the largest combined cover provided to the projects owned by a single corporate house in the country.A mega combined insurance policy has all the policies like fire, breakdown and loss of profit bundled together.Last year RIL had two insurers -- New India for the offshore cover and one of the Jamnagar refineries, while ICICI Lombard covered the other refinery.Last year ONGC had paid USD 16 million for its assets valued at USD 34 billion.

If we don&rsquo;t know where the stocks will open, we cannot decide where the stop losses would be. So I have tightened my stop losses and the trade is then if you look at this list, all of them are for buying apart from Kotak. They are all midcaps because that is where the action could be. If your entry price and your stop losses are close by and justify buying then go and buy them. If they don&rsquo;t, then you have to wait for the markets to quieten.&amp;quot;&amp;quot;With that caveat, there are a lot of midcaps where opportunities exists, Adani Power is making almost a perfect bullish pattern. It should go higher even if it doesn&rsquo;t do an intraday profitable trade today. We don&rsquo;t know how they will open and how they will move during the day. Then Bajaj Electricals - new highs in the stock, more upside is coming, Inox Leisure is a stock that has been building a base and is now breaking out. So it is also a positional trade.&amp;quot;&amp;quot;Finally, Texmaco Rail which had a big 40 percent decline. That decline has stopped.

            "Moneycontrol NewsICICI Prudential Life InsuranceKotak has initiated coverage on ICICI Prudential with add rating and target price of Rs 380 as it expects company to deliver 17 percent operating RoEV (return on embedded value) over the medium-term due to 39 percent CAGR on high ULIPs and margin protection policies.It feels current valuations priced in most of the positives. The brokerage house values company at Rs 54,000 crore (Rs 380 per share).It believes inflows in life insurance to grow at 18-20 percent CAGR between FY2016-20 and also believes ULIP inflows will be higher than that of traditional policies.Kotak sees huge potential for pure protection segment over the medium-term.IndustrialsJefferies says Siemens' 39 percent outperformance over ABB in the last 2 years (January 2015-March 2017) has been driven by the sharp margin improvement from cost initiatives.ABB's CY16 margin recovery was impacted by its investment with the parent. The brokerage house has lowered company's CY17-18 EPS estimates by 6-9 percent factoring some of this to continue and revised target price to Rs 1,540 from Rs 1700 earlier.However, as margin recovery plays out into CY17-18, Jefferies believes it will bridge this outperformance gap.&amp;quot;Barring the one-off investments with the parent in its export facilities, margins would have 9-9.5 percent against reported 8.6 percent for CY16. CY17-18 is expected to see far lower investments, and hence, we believe this margin recovery surprise will play out in CY17-18 for ABB,&amp;quot; it explains.Jefferies says Siemens' margin recovery story has played out into its Q1FY17 also, and hence it believes limited surprise scope potential leaves limited room for upside.Bharti AirtelDeutsche Bank says Bharti Airtel's deal with Millicom to combine operations in Ghana reflected continued progress on African restructuring. Hence, the brokerage house assigned buy rating on the stock, with a target price at Rs 400.GAILNomura says GAIL is its top pick in oil &amp;amp;amp; gas space and hence, maintained a buy call on the stock with a target price at Rs 620. Time-swap deal with Gunvor should further ease market concerns, it believes.However, Bank of America Merrill Lynch has reiterated underperform rating on the stock, with a target price at Rs 422 as it feels sluggish domestic demand is a key risk.It says Gunvor deal would be incrementally positive but concerns on selling rest of the volume could present a downside. Earnings momentum is intact, but risk/reward is unfavourable, BoAML feels.Reliance IndustriesCredit Suisse has neutral rating on Reliance Industries as it believes the stock is already pricing in Jio transitioning to a top-2 telecom player (25 percent market share). However, it increased target price to Rs 1,200 from Rs 1,020.The brokerage house expects two-pronged strategy from Reliance Jio. &amp;quot;One is for higher ARPU customers, retain data rates lower than incumbents, beyond March 2017, to encourage switching; and&amp;amp;nbsp; second for others (primarily voice), launch an affordable 4G smart feature phone, with upfront payment and nominal monthly payments; in addition, tariffs for the current Rs 149 plan (which incumbents nearly match) may need a re-look as well,&amp;quot; it explains.As this high-competition scenario plays out, Jio can make rapid gains in market share, Credit Suisse says.It expects aggregate industry average revenue per user for next 2 years to stay below FY17 level.Credit Suisse says RIL's refining/petchem projects should commission over the next two quarters, adding USD 3.2 billion to EBITDA at peak. Given FY18 telecom capex and USD 7.8 billion in vendor payables, Reliance (consolidated) turns free cash flow positive in second half of FY19.Disclosure: Reliance Industries, the parent company of Reliance Jio, owns Network 18 that publishes Moneycontrol.com.\n",

Another plan offers 60 GB (2GB daily data allowance) and unlimited voice for Rs 499,&amp;amp;rdquo; it said.Jio will also offer long duration plans for Rs 999/1999/4999/9999 with validity for 60/90/180/360 days and data allowance of 60/125/350/750GB without any daily limits, according to CLSA.Spelling out the fine print of Jio new tariff plans, the CLSA note stated that while subscription to Jio apps is available to all these plans, the company has limited free voice up to the first 1,000 minutes/month, after which only calls within the Jio network will be free.Also, &amp;quot;Jio Prime membership and its benefits could be cancelled unless a minimum recharge of Rs 149 is made every month,&amp;quot; it said.Jio Tariff After 31st MarchFor users who fail to sign up for the Jio Prime subscription before March 31, Jio will announce standard plans that will&amp;amp;nbsp;not only match the tariff plans of its rivals but will also offer 20 percent more data compared to its peers, Reliance Industries Chairman Mukesh Ambani&amp;amp;nbsp;had said on February 21.Aggressive Push In his address last week, Ambani had said that Jio crossed 100 million subscribers. Jio will be keen on holding on to these subscribers while adding more users. For this, the telecom company is offering commission rates higher than the industry norm, CLSA said.&amp;amp;ldquo;Our discussion with channel partners reveals that Jio has also offered much higher commission rates of over 6 percent on recharge versus industry average of sub-3 percent. While we find the tariffs quite attractive for data users, high commission rates should provide an added push for high membership of Jio Prime and allow Jio to start with a high chargeable subscriber base,&amp;amp;rdquo; the CLSA note stated.Jio had crossed 50 million subscribers in just 83 days of its launch, adding at an average rate of 6 lakh subscribers per day and surpassing the subscriber addition rates of global giants like Facebook, WhatsApp and Skype. Announcing its third quarter results, Reliance Industries had said that Jio has garnered 72.4 million subscribers as of December 31, 2016.Rivals May Not Catch UpCLSA is apprehensive about the capability of Airtel, Vodafone, Idea and others to match the tariffs offered in Jio Prime plan. &amp;amp;ldquo;These plans again underscore that Jio is playing the capacity game. Given its huge capacity advantage, we believe incumbents may find it difficult to match this offer without impacting user experience on their networks,&amp;quot; it said adding that &amp;quot;While one may find the Rs149/month plan as ARPU dilutive, Jio is possibly using this to entice users into building habits of higher data and video usage as it offers its Jio apps free along with this,&amp;amp;rdquo; it said in the note.The Reliance Jio EffectJio's entry has pushed the telecom sector into a consolidation mode. Last week,&amp;amp;nbsp;India&amp;amp;rsquo;s largest telecom operator Bharti Airtel announced that it had entered into &amp;quot;definitive agreement&amp;quot; to acquire Telenor India assets.Meanwhile, Vodafone Plc has also announced that it is in exploratory talks with the Aditya Birla Group's telecom arm Idea Cellular for a merger. &amp;quot;Vodafone confirms that it is in discussions with the Aditya Birla Group about an all share merger of Vodafone India (excluding Vodafone's 42% stake in Indus Towers) and Idea. Any merger would be effected through the issue of new shares in Idea to Vodafone and would result in Vodafone deconsolidating Vodafone India,&amp;quot; Vodafone had said in a statement earlier in February.(Disclosure: Reliance Industries, which own Jio, also owns Network18 which publishes Moneycontrol)\n",

            "The recent announcement that Reliance Jio would start charging its customers has got a thumbs-up from the Street. While it will undoubtedly have a positive rub off on RIL, what&acirc;&euro;&trade;s surprising is the market&acirc;&euro;&trade;s optimism about its competitors.\n",
            "Madhuchanda DeyMoneycontrol ResearchThe recent announcement that Reliance Jio would start charging its customers has got a thumbs-up from the Street. While it will undoubtedly have a positive rub off on RIL, what&amp;amp;rsquo;s surprising is the market&amp;amp;rsquo;s optimism about its competitors. The market appears to be reading this as an end of &amp;amp;lsquo;price war&amp;amp;rsquo; and the beginning of a &amp;amp;lsquo;golden era&amp;amp;rsquo; of pricing discipline, thereby benefitting all in an oligopolistic market place.Since the Jio announcement, shares of Bharti Airtel have ticked up 1 percent, and Idea shares have risen 10 percent. Some of this is due to consolidation talk, and this may be valid reason, but crunching the numbers swiftly dispels happy thoughts about the end of the price war.In terms of revenue, the size of the Indian telecom industry is roughly Rs 2,03,630 crore. Airtel with nearly 28 percent share followed by Vodafone at 21 percent and Idea at 18 percent lead the pack. While in the past couple of years, the cost of spectrum acquisition was the bone of contention, from the latter half of 2016, the industry woke up to the challenge of a competitor who had been creating significant capacity ahead of the launch.The key differentiator for the challenger is clearly the capacity it has put in place. Reliance Jio has the longest fibre optic network in the country, ranging over 2.5 lakh kilometres of fibre. Put this in perspective &amp;amp;ndash; this is more than two times the combined investment of Airtel, Idea and Vodafone in the 4G segment.Once the fibre optic network is in place, the cost of operating it is not very huge. The network can be operated at minimal cost. The network is capable enough to handle amazing internet speeds. It therefore encourages the users to use internet, which is handy because the key is to get more internet users.Given the capex headstart of Jio, if the industry has to benefit from RJio starting to charge for its offering, only those operators with sizeable data coverage and capacity will be able to protect their market shares and benefit from the industry&amp;amp;rsquo;s ARPU (Average Revenue per User) accretion. For most incumbents it will come at higher incremental capex. Thus there appears to be a strong &amp;amp;lsquo;economic rationale&amp;amp;rsquo; for consolidation in the industry, as the individual over-leveraged balance sheet may not be able to support the same.Contrary to popular perception that higher paying customers will stick to their existing service providers, we feel once Jio starts charging, it might decongest the network and encourage more migration from incumbent operators. Jio&amp;amp;rsquo;s network coverage appears significantly ahead of others and the company has just announced further capex investments in coming months to add capacity and coverage.Reliance Jio has incurred a total capex of Rs 1,70, 000 crore in telecom and it has further announced capex to the tune of Rs 30,000 crore. If we conservatively assume that the company expects a return of a modest 15 percent in the next five years, our calculation suggests that it will have to hit an annual revenue number of at least Rs 1,24,000 crore by FY22.This figure will require at least 306 million subscribers &amp;amp;ndash; 3x of the present subscriber base and nearly 42 percent of the revenue market share. To put the figures in perspective, the current subscriber base of the industry is approximately 1,074 million and Airtel (currently the leader) has 266 million subscribers.India being a well-penetrated voice market, the incremental growth in the market will come from data. So the price war may have temporarily abated, the battle in the &amp;amp;lsquo;data market&amp;amp;rsquo; has just begun. The stock price of the incumbents may have factored in lot more optimism than what the hard facts suggest.Disclosure: Reliance Industries, which owns Reliance Jio, also owns Network18, which publishes Moneycontrol.com.\n",

            "The market was clearly caught on the wrong foot when Reliance Jio announced that there would be no more free usage for its telecom services. Reliance Industries stock zoomed by over 10 percent, trading above the Rs 1,200 mark for the first time since 2008.\n",
            "Shishir AsthanaMoneycontrol ResearchThe market was clearly caught on the wrong foot when Reliance Jio announced that there would be no more free usage for its telecom services. Reliance Industries&amp;amp;nbsp;stock zoomed by over 10 percent, trading above the Rs 1,200 mark for the first time since 2008. The incremental jump in market capitalisation of Rs 38,748 crore almost matches the total market capitalisation of Idea Cellular, which stands at Rs 40,501 crore.The expectation was that the company might either continue with its policy of free data and voice until the end of 2017 as it builds up its customer base. Reliance surprised most by announcing a plan of Rs 303 per month for 1 GB per day data and free voice calling for all existing subscribers and new ones who enroll before March 31 by paying Rs 99 as enrollment fee.The figure of Rs 303 per month did the trick for investors. Reports say that Reliance Jio is likely to touch a sales of Rs 1 lakh crore and a subscriber base of 400 million by FY18.For many analysts the tariff plan was a sign that a large portion of the company&amp;amp;rsquo;s balance sheet which was not contributing to the revenue will now be put in play. At Rs 1 lakh crore Jio is expected to contribute nearly one-fourth of the company&amp;amp;rsquo;s revenue of around Rs 4 lakh crore by FY18.Over the past four years analysts were obsessed with Reliance Jio&amp;amp;rsquo;s investment. At nearly Rs 2 lakh crore the company had invested about 45 percent of its total capital expenditure over the last four years. However, given the crowded telecom space and initial teething problems in the technology, analysts were not ascribing too much value to the telecom investment in its sum-of-the-parts valuation matrix.Morgan Stanley valued Reliance Jio at Rs 193 per share based on a 0.36 multiple of enterprise value to invested capital. However, in comparison Idea Cellular was trading at a multiple of 1. If Reliance Jio is measured on the same valuation its telecom venture will be valued at Rs 536 per share.Telecom was the only missing link in Reliance&amp;amp;rsquo;s re-rating. The company is in the last leg of its massive capital expenditure. Analyst Jal Irani, in an interview with CNBC TV18, pointed out that Reliance&amp;amp;rsquo;s projects in the commissioning stage are almost double its productive assets, and the market has not been giving value to these projects.Further, Reliance is in a sweet spot as far as its telecom venture is concerned. A Credit Suisse report points out that Reliance Jio has 94 percent of India&amp;amp;rsquo;s mobile data traffic. Incumbents like Bharti Airtel, Vodafone and Idea Cellular are far behind Reliance Jio in terms of both data coverage and 4G coverage, says the report.Stretched balance sheet sat its competitors would help Reliance keep intact a large portion of its customer base, which in any case has been addicted to high-speed data over the last few months. A Goldman Sachs report points out that 10 percent of Indian mobile subscribers with an average revenue per user (ARPU) of Rs 600 account for 40 percent of industry revenues and this segment would find the Jio offer attractive.Further, Jio&amp;amp;rsquo;s offer packs more punch with a 1 GB per day for Rs 303 per month as compared to other players who offer a 1 GB per month pack for similar pricing.Reliance&amp;amp;rsquo;s plan to cover 99 percent of the country by the end of 2017 and 400 million subscribers from the present level of 100 million has given more visibility to analysts who are now plugging in the new set of numbers to revalue the shares.Reliance Jio, through its free introductory offer, managed to acquire 100 million subscribers, many of whom are believed to be using it as a second SIM in their mobiles. But if the company is able to provide quality high speed connectivity, then its pricing point is just right for Jio to be used as the primary SIM. Little wonder Reliance shares added an Idea Cellular in one day.(Disclosure: RIL, which owns Reliance Jio, also owns Network18 and&amp;amp;nbsp;moneycontrol.com).\n",

            "Moneycontrol BureauReliance Jio&amp;amp;rsquo;s decision to announce a new tariff plan for its existing 10 crore subscribers, and those who sign up before March 31, will put a ceiling on the revenues of incumbent operators, a note by broking firm Credit Suisse said Wednesday.At a press conference yesterday, Reliance Industries chief Mukesh Ambani said starting April 1, Jio will launch a Prime offer, under which users can opt for its ongoing free calls, free data (subject to 1GB per day) and get access to its media suite for a one-time fee of Rs 99 and a Rs 303 monthly plan.For other subscribers who take up Jio&amp;amp;rsquo;s services after April 1, Ambani said the telecom company&amp;amp;rsquo;s tariff plans will offer 20 percent more data than any competitor.In a note to clients, Credit Suisse said it would continue to stay &amp;amp;ldquo;cautious&amp;amp;rdquo; on the stock price outlook for most listed telecom companies as Jio&amp;amp;rsquo;s aggressive pricing plans will pressure their revenues, especially from high-value customers.&amp;amp;ldquo;Nearly 50 percent of revenues for incumbent operators like&amp;amp;nbsp;Bharti&amp;amp;nbsp;come from subscribers with Rs 300+ average revenue per user. The Rs 303 plan will put an ARPU ceiling on all such subscribers,&amp;amp;rdquo; analysts at the firm wrote.The report added that while recent news over mergers and acquisitions in the telecom space &amp;amp;ndash; again thanks to Jio &amp;amp;ndash; had helped shares, &amp;amp;ldquo;we see no let down in&amp;amp;nbsp;Jio's&amp;amp;nbsp;competitive aggression, which is likely to determine earnings for next couple of years.&amp;amp;rdquo;According to Jefferies, the Rs 303 plan was the most &amp;amp;ldquo;disruptive&amp;amp;rdquo; announcement by Jio.Given the way Jio's plans are structured and how incumbents have responded over the past quarter, &amp;amp;ldquo;focus should be solely on ARPU which would also come under pressure,&amp;amp;rdquo; said the Jefferies note to clients.But Jefferies also cautioned that the challenge for R Jio will be to maintain quality of services&amp;amp;nbsp;as there issues relating to point of interconnect and data speeds, which according to TRAI have been lower than Airtel. These would put to test Jio&amp;amp;rsquo;s ability to retain customers once they start charging for services, it said.Ambani yesterday announced that Jio, which launched services on September 5 last year, had continued to add subscribers at a healthy rate, crossing 10 crore subscribers in less than 6 months of launch.Market leader Bharti Airtel has 26.5 crore subscribers. Idea, which is in merger talks with Vodafone, has 18.5 crore.The RIL chief added that Jio carried 1 billion GB of data on its network last month -- 5.8 times and 10 times that of Airtel and Idea respectively, according to Jefferies &amp;amp;ndash; while 55 million hours of videos being used daily.Ambani also said the company will increase its coverage ratio of 99 percent of the country&amp;amp;rsquo;s population by 2017 end.\n",

            "Reliance Industries finally revealed its pricing plans for its telecom venture Reliance Jio. The tariff plans will start from April 1, 2017 as its Happy New Year offer which gave 1 GB of free data per day ends on March 31.\n",
            "Shishir AsthanaMoneycontrol ResearchReliance Industries finally revealed its pricing plans for its telecom venture Reliance Jio. The tariff plans will start from April 1, 2017 as its Happy New Year offer which gave 1 GB of free data per day ends on March 31.In the new plan,&amp;amp;nbsp;domestic voice calls will be free even after April 1, 2017. As for data, Reliance Industries Chairman Mukesh Ambani said that Jio will offer 20 percent more data than&amp;amp;nbsp;the best plan offered by any rival operator.Jio&amp;amp;rsquo;s aggressive pricing suggests that the price war is here to stay. Telecom companies were banking on data as the driver for growth. December quarter numbers clearly showed the impact of Reliance Jio offer on these companies. Idea Cellular posted a 6.9 percent drop in its revenue and a 550 basis points drop in operating profit on a quarter on quarter basis. On account of its high operating loss the company ended up posting a loss of Rs 380 crore.Bharti Airtel on the other hand saw its revenue fall by 5 percent and consolidated EBIDTA by 10 percent. Its presence in other markets helped the company cushion the impact of its India performance. Though Vodafone does not disclose its Indian numbers separately, its parent company had recorded a non-cash impairment charge of five&amp;amp;nbsp;billion Euros for the six months ended 30th September 2016, highlighting the pressure in its Indian operations.However, December 2016 quarter impact will be smaller than that in March 2017 quarter when the first full quarter of Jio impact would be felt on the telcos.Market will be closely watching the stickiness of Reliance&amp;amp;rsquo;s 100 million consumers post the scheme launch. Average Revenue Per User (ARPU) for data of Idea and Bharti is Rs 200 per subscriber per month and a wireless ARPU of Rs 160 per user per month. Reliance has priced its product at Rs 303 to attract a major portion of the fastest growing data market. An important point worth noting is that the scheme announced by Reliance is a prepaid one meant to tap the low-end users.By offering a limited window of March 1 to March 31 for availing of Jio Prime Membership Programme, Reliance wants to add as many members as possible to its list before the revenue plan goes live.But whether the pricing is attractive enough to retain a portion of its present consumers intact will depend on how the other telecom players place themselves. The impact on them will actually be felt post April and the June quarter will be the most keenly awaited one for these telecom players.Here is a back-of-the-envelope calculation to show where Reliance is relative to its rivals. Based on the pricing announced by Reliance, it would require the company to have 100 million subscribers to the Jio Prime Membership Programme for its quarterly revenues to match Idea Cellular&amp;amp;rsquo;s standalone quarterly revenue and 170 million to match Bharti Airtel&amp;amp;rsquo;s quarterly revenue.It&amp;amp;rsquo;s difficult to predict, but if 60 percent of current users stay and another 40 million sign up, it would mean that Jio is already at par with Idea, and would have exceeded Idea if there were migrations away from the Birla group company.Given Reliance&amp;amp;rsquo;s history and modus operandi the company would continue with its aggressive pricing till it gets a lion&amp;amp;rsquo;s share of the market. Consolidation in the industry is unlikely to deter Reliance in its aggressive posture for gaining market share.Disclosure: Reliance Industries, which owns Reliance Jio, also owns Network18, which publishes Moneycontrol.com.\n",

            "8:00 PM That's a wrap from us. We've got plenty of stories in the pipeline on Reliance Jio's future plans and what it means for consumers and the industry. Stay tuned to our homepage for more. Thank you.7:15 PM Mukesh Ambani reiterated on Tuesday that voice calls would remain free. Many had considered this to be unprecedented, but Ambani himself explained a year ago that it is not:&amp;amp;ldquo;I had met the CEO of Verizon and he had said, &amp;amp;lsquo;Oh in your country you still charge for voice? We stopped doing that long ago.&amp;quot; This was 2014. The world-over, it has happened. We have been consistently saying this, but nobody believed us.&amp;amp;rdquo;6:45 PM Apart from 4G services, Reliance Jio has of late also been trying to reach out to customers who have outdated smartphones that only support 2G/3G connectivity. Its Jio-Fi device serves a portable hotspot that allows free 4G calls through the Jio app and 1 GB free data daily.6:30 PM&amp;amp;nbsp;Here is a back-of-the-envelope calculation to show where Reliance is relative to its rivals. Based on the pricing announced by Reliance, it would require the company to have 100 million subscribers to the Jio Prime Membership Programme for its quarterly revenues to match Idea Cellular&amp;amp;rsquo;s standalone quarterly revenue and 170 million to match Bharti Airtel&amp;amp;rsquo;s quarterly revenue.6:10 PM To put things in perspective, a Jio Prime member will pay Rs 3636 till March 31, 2018 to avail of unlimited free calls and 1 GB free data daily.5:45 PM A quick look at what Jio's competitors currently charge prepaid customers tells quite a story. While Airtel charges Rs 296 for 1 GB of data, Vodafone has a plan where you get 1 GB for 24 hours at Rs 97. Jio Prime subscribers will pay just Rs 10 per GB.5:30 PM For those of you who want to sign up for Jio Prime membership, you can do so from March 1 through the app or by visiting your nearest Reliance Jio/Reliance Digital outlet.5:15 PM A potential hurdle for Jio's expansion could be that it still does not have sufficient points of interconnect. The country's telecom regulator had earlier recommended a combined penalty of Rs 3,050 crore on Idea, Airtel and Vodafone for denying Reliance Jio adequate points of interconnect in most telecom circles. It&amp;amp;nbsp;contended that the carriers&amp;amp;rsquo; actions appeared to be&amp;amp;nbsp;aimed at stifling competition and were against public interest.&amp;amp;nbsp;5:00 PM&amp;amp;nbsp;Moneycontrol's Shishir Asthana weighs in with a comment piece on what Jio's plans&amp;amp;nbsp;could mean for the industry. Do read:Jio's pricing suggests bloodbath ahead for other telcos&amp;amp;nbsp;4:45 PM&amp;amp;nbsp;Before Jio&amp;amp;rsquo;s launch, incumbent operators were on an average charging Rs 250 per GB of data. With the Jio Prime Offer announced on Tuesday exclusively for its 100 million subscribers, the price of 1 GB of data has effectively been beaten down to Rs 10.4:30 PM RIL Chairman Mukesh Ambani sent out a subtle message to Jio's competitors while announcing the new tariff plans. Here's what he said:&amp;quot;In the last few months, hundreds of offers have been launched by the industry. These plans have created a lot of confusion in the markets and customers are having what I call 'data&amp;amp;nbsp;and value anixety',&amp;amp;nbsp;whether they are getting the best value for the price that they are paying.&amp;quot;4:15 PM It's going to be interesting to see how other telecom operators react. Jio has basically thrown down the gauntlet by saying whatever data plans you offer, we will give 20% more data for the same price.4:00 PM&amp;amp;nbsp;Jio users consume nearly as much mobile data&amp;amp;nbsp;as the entire United States of America, and nearly 50 percent more mobile data&amp;amp;nbsp;than all of China.3:46 PM Analysts tracking the telecom sector point out that Jio's announcement of charging customers post April is actually beneficial for incumbents as they can now compete on tariffs and work to retain customers.&amp;amp;nbsp;3:38 PM&amp;amp;nbsp;Full text of RIL Chairman Mukesh Ambani's speech on Jio 3:34 PM If you want mega returns, you need panic and that panic which was there in telecom three-four months back is missing now. So, I would say there is no panic in any sector at this point of time,&amp;amp;nbsp;says&amp;amp;nbsp;S Naren, Executive Director at Chief Investment Officer at ICICI Prudential in an interview with CNBC-TV18.3:32 PM&amp;amp;nbsp;Telecom subscriber base grew by 21.02 million to cross 1.12 billion at end-November 2016 on account of large number of additions by Reliance Jio.&amp;amp;nbsp;3:23 PM In a Q3 FY17 result analysis of Idea Cellular, Jeffries identified telecom&amp;amp;nbsp;issues &amp;amp;ndash; weak voice, increased capex&amp;amp;nbsp;for data and intensifying competitive&amp;amp;nbsp;intensity due to entry of R Jio. R Jio puts question on Idea&amp;amp;rsquo;s positioning as&amp;amp;nbsp;the third largest operator, partially offset by the merger discussion with Vodafone, said the report.3:22 PM In an interview with CNBC-TV18&amp;amp;nbsp;GV Giri, Head of Research at IIFL said that there should be a healthy reasonable concentration of market power in the hands of these three-four players compared to what we have seen in the last 7-8 years because that has been very detrimental for their profitability and their ability to invest. 3:17 PM Tata Teleservices &amp;amp;nbsp;and&amp;amp;nbsp; Reliance Communications-Aircel-MTS combine are reportedly considering joining forces to counter the tough competition from Reliance Jio Infocomm, reported the Economic Times yesterday. In the light of possible mergers, a few strong players will come to dominate the market.3:15 PM&amp;amp;nbsp;The telecom industry is heading for a consolidation with Vodafone and Idea merger around the corner.&amp;amp;nbsp;If the deal is successful, the combined entity will create India's largest telecom firm with a revenue share of around 40 percent and a subscriber base of over 380 million, according to India Ratings and Research.&amp;amp;nbsp;3:05 PM 9 key takeaways2:42 PM Read: Mukesh Ambani: Jio crosses 100mn customers, to cover 99% of population in 20172:30 PM Other financial dailies -- The Economic Times and Business Standard -- have also reported on Ambani's Jio briefing.2:27 PM&amp;amp;nbsp;Mahesh Uppal of Com First India said that the viability model of the sector is under a cloud, although it is good news for customers.2:25 PM&amp;amp;nbsp;Shares of Idea Cellular fell nearly 2 percent intraday, while Bharti Airtel fell over 3 percent intraday, following the announcements.2:23 PM&amp;amp;nbsp;Telecom stocks fell between two and three percent intraday, possibly following the positive announcements made by Ambani for its Jio customers.&amp;amp;nbsp;2:18 PM Listed companies were waiting for Jio to start charging customers. From hereon, the case for incumbents improves a little bit, says an analyst.2:17 PM&amp;amp;nbsp;Ambani&amp;amp;nbsp;needs to increase market share. He has largest market share in terms of traffic in data. He wants users and eventually a share of revenues. It is good for the consumer. It will take a huge pressure off the incumbents., says an analyst.2:13 PM&amp;amp;nbsp;Airtel is down by 2.3 percent. Idea is down by 0.5 percent.2:09 PM&amp;amp;nbsp;Ambani finishes his speech.2:08 PM&amp;amp;nbsp;A custom-made programme Jio Prime Membership programme will be available for ony current Jio customers and for those who&amp;amp;nbsp;noin us or before mMarch 31.

Every single day, Jio users make more than 200 crore minutes of voice and video calls. Before Jio, India was 150th in world&amp;amp;rsquo;s broadband penenetration for data. Last month, Jio users consumed more than 100 crore gigabytes of data.&amp;amp;nbsp;1:55 PM&amp;amp;nbsp;Jio has added&amp;amp;nbsp;7 customers on its network every single second of every single day within those 170 days, says Ambani.1:50 PM&amp;amp;nbsp;Ambani begins speech. Says within 170 days of its launch,&amp;amp;nbsp;Jio&amp;amp;nbsp;has crossed the 100 million customer mark on wireless broadband network. He thanks every of his customers. An achievement of India and Indians, says Ambani.1:45 PM&amp;amp;nbsp;Airtel reached the 50-million milestone in 12 years and 100 million in a further 3 years. Vodafone and Idea took 13 years each.1:40 PM&amp;amp;nbsp;Telecom industry acquired 100 million subscribers in 13 years.1:30 PM&amp;amp;nbsp;Telecom stocks in focus ahead of Ambani's briefing.1:15 PM&amp;amp;nbsp;Jio's Happy New Year offer, which offers free voice and data services, lapses on March 31. The question on everyone's mind is whether Jio will look to extend the offer? The other option, according to CNBC-TV18, could be that Jio may start a commercial launch. Analysts say the company is likely to announce plans for new subscribers.For Bharti and&amp;amp;nbsp;Idea, voice and data revenues fell in excess of 10 percent on a quarter on quarter basis in Q3. Jio acquired 50 million subscribers in 83 days since commercial launch on September 5 and 100 million in 170 days.In this period, industry&amp;amp;rsquo;s total connection growth rates have declined.&amp;amp;nbsp;1:10 PM Last week, in Nasscom Leadership summit, Reliance Industries Chairman Mukesh Ambani said his telecom venture Jio has crossed a customer base of 100 million. &amp;quot;When we started Jio, we set a target for ourselves that we will acquire 100 million customers in shortest time. Even we didn't imagine that we would do it in months,&amp;quot; Ambani said.Jio crossed 50 million subscribers in just 83 days, adding at an average rate of 6 lakh subscribers per day and surpassing the subscriber addition rates of global giants like Facebook, WhatsApp and Skype.Speaking at the summit, Ambani said data will be the &amp;amp;ldquo;next oil&amp;amp;rdquo; &amp;amp;ndash; reinforcing an opinion he had expressed at the launch of the multi-billion dollar Reliance Jio venture &amp;amp;ndash; and said it would trigger the fourth revolution.Analysts say that Jio might not go for a commercial launch, given the fact that interconnect issues aren't sorted out yet. According to an article in the Economic Times, it is estimated that about 40 percent of voice calls will be riding on VoLTE (voice over LTE technology with 4G) by 2020. The paper was quoting Aircel's Chief Technology Officer Sameer Dave.(Disclosure: RIL, which owns Reliance Jio, also owns Network18 and&amp;amp;nbsp;moneycontrol.com).\n",

Even we didn't imagine that we would do it in months,&amp;quot; Ambani said at the three-day Nasscom leadership forum here.The company has been providing free 4G service since its soft launch on December 27, 2015 for RIL employees only and later opened it for all customers on September 5, 2016 thus completing over 160 days of its commercial operations.&amp;quot;We just set ourselves a goal. Aadhaar enabled us to acquire a million customer a day which is unheard of in the industry as a whole,&amp;quot; Ambani said.The company provides connection on basis of instant verification of Aadhaar number of customers.Jio crossed 50 million subscribers in just 83 days, adding at an average rate of 6 lakh subscribers per day and surpassing the subscriber addition rates of global giants like Facebook, WhatsApp and Skype.More recently, announcing its third quarter results, Reliance Industries had said that its telecom subsidiary Jio has garnered 72.4 million subscribers as of December 31, 2016.However, the rapid ramp-up of subscriber base comes amid company's ongoing stand-off with incumbent operators over network connectivity issues where Jio's rivals have claimed to have provided it more than sufficient connection points for its subscribers growth which the Ambani led firm has strongly denied.On February 8 this year, Airtel said it had provided adequate interconnect capacity to Jio to serve over 190 million customers and that the newcomer has been unable to activate all the points of interconnect (PoIs) and utilise the said capacity.Mukesh Ambani-promoted Reliance Jio, however, termed Airtel's claim as &amp;quot;malicious and misleading&amp;quot;.Disclosure: RIL, which owns Reliance Jio, also owns Network18 and moneycontrol.com.\n",

            "On his return from the Stanford Business School in 1981, Reliance Industries chairman Mukesh Ambani recalls asking his father about what his (Mukesh's) responsibilities in the company would be.His father had replied that he was not going to assign him any duties in the business. Rather, he told Mukesh to figure things out himself and left it to him to decide how he wanted to begin work at Reliance Industries.&amp;quot;That was the most valuable lesson in entrepreneurship of my life,&amp;quot; said Ambani, at the NASSCOM India Leadership Forum.&amp;quot;My father said&amp;amp;nbsp;if you want to become an entrepreneur you will have to figure things out on your own. Only managers are told what is to be done, not entrepreneurs,&amp;quot; Ambani continues.Another vital lesson in entrepreneurship, was given to him by a professor at the University. He had told Ambani, that a leader never asks for the problems that need to be solved.

Along with solving problems of the company, it should also deal with problems that are faced by the people around a company, he said.&amp;quot;Financial returns are a by-product of this. If you focus only on returns, chances are you would not be able to ever meet your passion,&amp;quot; he adds.Despite running a multi-billion dollar company, Ambani said he has faced many failures in his life. He said, &amp;quot;Failures are normal, people have not seen how many times I have failed.&amp;quot;He said it is best to learn from them than to give up.Although&amp;amp;nbsp;failures are something he can live with, he cannot accept disappointing investors.&amp;quot;It is important to treat investor money more carefully than your own money,&amp;quot; he says.Another true quality of an entrepreneur, he says, is positivity.

            "Singapore-based arbitrator Prof Lawrence Boo has been named as the presiding judge of a three- member arbitration panel that will go into the validity of government's demand of USD 1.55 billion compensation from Reliance Industries for &amp;quot;unfairly&amp;quot; producing ONGC's gas.Government of India has named former Supreme Court Judge G S Singhvi as its nominee on the three-member arbitration panel, while RIL and its partners BP plc of UK and Canada's Niko Resources have named former UK High Court Judge Bernard Eder to the panel.&amp;quot;The two arbitrators (appointed by Government and RIL-BP) have agreed on Boo as the third/presiding arbitrator,&amp;quot; a senior Oil Ministry official said. &amp;quot;The Arbitral Tribunal is fully constituted now.&amp;quot; The full arbitration panel was constituted in less than three months of RIL-BP-Niko slapping an arbitration notice on November 11 last year, thereby showing intent of quickly resolving the sticky issue, he said.Normally, it can take up to an year for the full panel to be constituted.The Oil Ministry had on November 3 last year issued a notice to RIL, Niko and UK's BP Plc seeking USD 1.47 billion for producing in the seven years ended March 31, 2016 about 338.332 million British thermal units of gas that had seeped or migrated from the state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corporation's (ONGC) blocks into their adjoining KG-D6 in the Bay of Bengal.After deducting USD 71.71 million royalty paid on the gas produced and adding an interest at the rate of Libor plus 2 per cent, totalling USD 149.86 million, a total demand of USD 1.55 billion was made on RIL, BP and Niko.RIL is the operator of the KG-D6 block with 60 per cent interest while BP holds 30 per cent. The remaining 10 per cent is with Niko Resources.The official said the arbitration will now get underway.The government's compensation claim flowed from the report of the Justice (retd) A P Shah Committee.The Shah panel, in its August 28, 2016 report, concluded that there has been &amp;quot;unjust enrichment&amp;quot; to the contractor of the block KG-DWN-98/3 (KG-D6) due to production of the migrated gas from ONGC's blocks KG-DWN-98/2 and Godavari PML.The government, the official said, accepted the recommendations of the committee and consequently, decided to claim restitution from RIL-BP-Niko for &amp;quot;the unjust benefit received and unfairly retained&amp;quot;.So, a notice was sent, he said, adding that the government is also pressing RIL to pay USD 174.9 million of additional profit petroleum after certain costs were disallowed because of KG-D6 output being lower than targets.The cost recovery issue is also being arbitrated separately.Originally, ONGC had sued RIL for producing gas that had migrated from its blocks KG-DWN-98/2 (KG-D5) and Godavari PML in the KG basin to adjoining KG-D6 block of RIL.Under direction of the Delhi High Court, the government had appointed a one-man committee under retired Justice A P Shah to go into the issue. Shah however said the compensation should go to government as it is the owner of all unproduced natural resources.Reliance Industries owns TV18 Broadcast and Network 18 (that publishes Moneycontrol.com)\n",

            "The Budget-induced optimism got a leg to stand on as the Sensex today pushed higher for the fourth day by scoring 199 points to close at 28,439 -- a 4-month high -- after hopes built up that RBI might go in for a rate cut at the Wednesday's policy meet.\n",
            "The Budget-induced optimism got a leg to stand on as the Sensex today pushed higher for the fourth day by scoring 199 points to close at 28,439 -- a 4-month high -- after hopes built up that RBI might go in for a rate cut at the Wednesday's policy meet.The NSE Nifty retook the crucial 8,800-mark today.At its last policy review in December, RBI in a surprise move had decided to leave rates unchanged, but this time a lower retail inflation and fiscal discipline as shown in the Budget have prompted calls for RBI to remain accommodative.Global leads aligned as most Asian shares ended higher, tracking weekend gains in the US on better-than-expected jump in US jobs and a move by President Donald Trump to cut back financial regulations, accelerating buying pace by investors.The 30-share Sensex ended up 198.76 points, or 0.70 percent at 28,439.28, its highest closing since September 23 last year when it had closed at 28,668.22. Intra-day, it sprang to a high of 28,487.28.The gauge had rallied 584.56 points in the previous three sessions after the presentation of the Budget on February 1.The NSE Nifty regained control of the 8,800-mark and added 60.10 points, or 0.69 percent, at 8,801.05 at the close. On September 23, the index finished at 8,831.55.&amp;quot;Markets continued to be buoyant on the expectation of rate cut by RBI and positive global cues. We are seeing continuation of rally in the rate sensitive sectors led by reality, banks and FMCG which were also supported by Budget related sops,&amp;quot; said Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit BNP Paribas Financial Services.Major European indices stayed in the positive zone, too.Data showed that foreign institutional investors bought shares worth Rs 353.84 crore last Friday, adding to the level of optimism.The rupee appreciated for the 9th straight day to trade at a fresh 2-1/2 month high of 67.14 (intra-day) against the dollar, keeping the overall mood upbeat.A good 22 stocks in the 30-share Sensex pack advanced while 8 turned lower.Sun Pharma led the charge by surging 4.20 percent while ICICI Bank zoomed 3.18 percent.Adani Ports, Axis Bank, Hero MotoCorp, ITC Ltd, HUL, GAIL, NTPC, Asian Paints, Wipro, RIL, Tata Motors, Maruti Suzuki and L&amp;amp;amp;T supported the ongoing bull run.BSE realty jumped the most (up 1.90 percent) followed by FMCG (1.28 percent), healthcare (1.27 percent) and consumer durables (1.27 percent).Broader markets remained in the green too, with the mid-cap index advancing 1.10 percent and small-cap 0.88 percent.Realty stocks continued their upward journey, buoyed by the infrastructure status to affordable housing in the Budget 2017-18 to encourage investment in the segment, which offered tax sops to developers to complete unsold inventories.In the realty space, HDIL soared 7.80 percent, Godrej Properties surged 3.32 percent, Prestige Estates Projects 2.83 percent and DLF 1.32 percent.Asian shares, led by Hong Kong, closed higher.In Europe, London's FTSE was up 0.23 percent and Paris CAC 40 0.14 percent while Frankfurt edged down 0.14 percent.\n",

            "Moneycontrol BureauThe Aditya Birla Group may have to shell out around Rs 25,150 crore (USD 3.5 billion) to raise its stake in Idea Cellular or the stake in the joint venture with Vodafone in India, to have equal rights in the new entity, reports The Economic Times. Inversely, strategic investors could also purchase a piece of Vodafone Group's completely owned India wing.The new merged entity, add the analysts, may have the two holding 37.5 percent each in the joint venture.There is also a rumour that a major shareholder in Idea Cellular, Axiata, may let go of around 20 percent of its stake to make way for the Birlas to increase their shareholding in Idea before the merger.Birla Group currently holds 42 percent of Idea Cellular.With the rise in Idea's stock price, the Birla Group though, has been faced with a dilemma. In its pursuit to increase its stake in Idea, it may have to pay more to level its holding with Vodafone as merger talks heat up.Some analysts see another alternative on the cards as well, where Vodafone would hold a higher stake in the merged entity, but would give equal control to the Birlas.Merger talks ensued after Mukesh Ambani led Reliance Industries launched its telecom wing Reliance Jio, which introduced free unlimited calling and data to its users that shook the telecom space.Disclosure: RIL, which owns Reliance Jio, also owns Network18 and moneycontrol.com\n",

            "Reliance Industries Ltd has written down Rs 39,570 crore in value of its oil and gas assets including the flagging KG basin D6 block and US shale gas projects, in view of change in accounting policy.RIL has restated its reserves following a change in accounting standards from April 1, 2016. It has moved from the Full-Cost Method (Indian GAAP) to the Successful-Efforts Method under IND AS.This has led to devaluation of its oil and gas assets by Rs 39,570 crore as on March 31, 2016, according to RIL's third quarter earning statement.The write down investments reflects plummeting oil and gas prices.&amp;quot;The impact on account of change in accounting policy from FCM to SEM is recognised in the Opening Reserves on the date of transition and consequential impact of depletion and write offs is recognised in the Profit and Loss Account,&amp;quot; RIL said.Major differences impacting such change of accounting policy are in the areas of expenditure on surrendered blocks, unproved wells, abandoned wells, seismic and expired leases and licenses, it said.Transiting from one accounting method to another requires going back to the time when that asset was acquired and calculating its present book value if successful completion had been followed since then.RIL has taken a Rs 20,114 crore write-down on its KG-D6 block in the Bay of Bengal.In the October-December quarter, the company reported a pre-tax loss of Rs 295 crore from its oil and gas business mainly because of &amp;quot;continuing decline in domestic production and weak price realisations&amp;quot;.Gas price for KG-D6 reduced to USD 2.5 per million British thermal unit from USD 3.06 per mmBtu earlier.Its US shale performance improved q-o-q with higher realisations despite lower production. US shale production in 3Q FY17 was down 9 per cent at 37.5 billion cubic feet but price realisation was up 12 per cent at USD 2.85 per thousand cubic feet.KG-D6 production stood at 7.5 million standard cubic meters per day and 3,329 barrels per day of oil.

            "KR Choksey's research report on Reliance IndustriesReliance Industries Ltd (RIL) reported net profit of INR 7506 cr, below market expectation on the backdrop of lower refining margins (&amp;amp;#36;10.8/barrel Vs street expectations of &amp;amp;#36;11.5/barrel). Net profit increased 4.2% QoQ and 3.6% YoY; Rise in PAT is mainly on account of higher refining margins and stable production from refining and petchem segment. GRMs stood at USD 10.8/ barrel compared to USD 10.1/ barrel in Q2FY17 and USD 11.5 in Q3FY16. GRMs were higher QoQ because of increase in gasoline, diesel cracks.OutlookWe believe over the medium to long term refining margins to remain range bound as capacity additions though it is delayed will eventually match the demand growth. RIL will further gain from efficient crude sourcing and product placement. We expect RIL&amp;amp;rsquo;s GRMs to be between &amp;amp;#36;10.0-11.5/bbl in FY17 (will go up by &amp;amp;#36;2.5/bbl post commissioning of petcoke regasification terminal). We expect margins to remain stable in petchem segment along with the petchem capacity addition and operational optimization. We also remain very positive on Jio and believe that it will start contributing to the top line from FY 18 onwards. We recommend BUY with the target price of INR 1,457/share based on SOTP methodology.For all recommendations, click here Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts/broking houses/rating agencies on moneycontrol.com are their own, and not that of the website or its management.

Timelines for most other downstream projects were largely maintained.Motilal Oswal SecuritiesReliance Industries&amp;amp;rsquo; (RIL) reported 3QFY17 standalone EBITDA lower than our estimates at Rs 10600 crore (+3 percent YoY and flat QoQ) due to lower than estimated GRM and higher opex. PAT at Rs 8000 crore (+11 percent YoY and +4 percent QoQ) was in line with estimates due to higher other income and lower interest costs. Jio (telecom) has garnered 72.4 million subscribers and commercial launch will depend on resolution of interconnect issues. Management guides for further delays in ROGC (mechanical completion by 1QFY18) and petcoke gasifier projects (mechanical completion by June 2017). Key drivers for stock performance in the near-term would be core projects commissioning and subscriber ramp-up and ARPU in telecom.

Petchem EBIT at Rs 3360 crore&amp;amp;nbsp; (+30 percent YoY, -3 percent QoQ) with EBIT margin at 15.5 percent (16.3 percent in 2QFY17) was lower QoQ primarily due to demonetization affecting demand.Valuation and view: On FY19E basis, the stock trades at 9.5x adjusted SA EPS of Rs 113 and EV/EBITDA of 6.3x.

It maintains a neutral call.IIFLDuring the December quarter FY17, RIL reported a GRM of USD 10.8/bbl slightly better than our forecast of USD 10.6/bbl. Throughput declined on maintenance shutdowns. The performance was impacted by FCCU shutdowns. This was however, offset by strength witnessed in spreads of light and middle distillates along with stable-light heavy differentials, which have given an advantage to complex refiners. Outlook for the refining segment remains stable as petroleum product consumption growth is expected to sustain at 1.4 mbpd in line with past years, while capacity addition may not keep pace.The petchem segment reported a better-than-expected performance inspite of a difficult environment wherein demand in domestic market was impacted due to demonetization and product spreads were under pressure due to restart of capacities which were shut down. EBIT margin for the segment was at 15.5 percent compared to 16.3 percent in the previous quarter. While margins were in line, absolute spreads were better owning to higher than forecast realizations.Over the next three years, core businesses of refining and petchem will drive a strong 25 percent CAGR in standalone EBITDA on the back of commencement of large scale projects &amp;amp;ndash; off gas cracker and petcoke gasification.Edelweiss SecuritiesReliance Industries (RIL) delivered subdued operational performance for Q3FY17 with 3 percent miss on EBIT, dragged by tad-lower GRM (USD 10.8/bbl versus estimated USD 11/bbl).
